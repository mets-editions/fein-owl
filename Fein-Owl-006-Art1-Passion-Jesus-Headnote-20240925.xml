        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-006-Art1-Passion-Jesus-Headnote"/><div type="text">
 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">Appearing at the head of Oxford, Jesus College, MS 29 (II), <hi rend="italic">The Passion of Jesus Christ</hi> opens the book in commemoration of the Passion, given as a moral lesson with brief asides. This long poem paraphrases and blends the gospel narrative shared in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The poet’s intent is to preach a proper understanding of Jesus’s life. The “lutele tale” (line 1) he will tell, he says, is not of Charlemagne and his twelve peers, but rather of Christ’s suffering, and implicitly, too, the events touching the lives of the apostles. He begins by calling the <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> a stirring adventure of more significance than a popular tale could ever hold. The narrative of Christ’s suffering is offered as more properly edifying, kingly, and victorious than are tales of a worldly emperor.</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">After a short prologue, the poet sketches Christ’s main life events — birth, baptism, temptation by Satan, and ministry — paraphrasing brief bits of gospel. The narrative then proceeds according to Matthew 26–27, Mark 14–15, Luke 22–23, and John 13, 18–19. The key events, economically recounted, are the Last Supper, Judas’s betrayal of Jesus, Jesus seized by the Jews, Peter’s acts and denials, Jesus’s trial before Pilate, and the Crucifixion. The Resurrection is paraphrased in a last section under its own rubric. Borrowing mainly from John 20, but also from Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, and Acts 2, the poet depicts Mary Magdalene at the tomb, Christ’s appearance before her, Christ’s coming among the apostles, and Christ’s Ascension to heaven. The <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> concludes with a prayer for the writer and those “bothe yonge and olde” of his “ordre” (lines 699–700). The prayer in combination with the moralizing glosses implies that the author was a friar, a canon, or a monk.</p>
 <p style="body" n="2">Directed at an audience “in English” (as the incipit stresses) and projecting a popular narrative style, the <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi>’s religious directives reinforce the absolute importance of confession — an annual imperative decreed for all Christians in England after the reforms enacted by the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) — a standard theme for an evangelizing preacher and working confessor. Some strategic repetitions emphasize that Judas, in betraying Jesus, acted like Satan when he tempted Christ, and that Satan, in wanting folks to sin, acts like the envious Jews who conspired to kill Jesus. Fear of death is normal — indeed, Jesus felt it — but with God’s Passion and confession as shields, one need fear neither death nor the pains of hell. A countervailing message of God’s love is shown to exist in the Passion narrative, which makes the doctrinal theme of this long scriptural paraphrase congruent with the softened strains of Friar Thomas of Hales in <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> or the poet of <hi rend="italic">A Homily on Sooth Love</hi> (arts. 19, 26).</p>
 <p style="body" n="3"><hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> is written in a Southwestern dialect in agreement with the provenance of Jesus 29. The Gospels and Acts are probably the direct source for <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi>, but other well-disseminated analogues may have been known by the poet, in particular, <hi rend="italic">The Gospel of Nicodemus</hi> and Herman de Valenciennes’s <hi rend="italic">La Passioun Nostre Seignour</hi> (ca. 1188–1195). The former presents, as biblical apocrypha, the trial before Pilate and the Crucifixion in legalistic detail; the latter paraphrases the Gospels in Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italic">laisses</hi>, while dramatically heightening, contrasting, and psychologizing the tortured emotions of Judas and Peter. Both works survive in thirteenth-century Anglo-Norman copies in another trilingual West Midland miscellany: MS Harley 2253 (<hi rend="italic">CHMS</hi>, 1:208–359). The varied contents of Jesus 29 include two more biblical paraphrases: <hi rend="italic">The Woman of </hi><hi rend="italic">Samaria</hi> (art. 5) and the Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italic">Tobias</hi> (Reinsch, ed., “La vie de Tobie”). Another Jesus 29 text has an incipit that states its English language: <hi rend="italic">Antiphon of Saint Thomas </hi><hi rend="italic">the Martyr in English </hi>(art. 17).</p>
 <p style="body" n="4">Enlarged, decorated capitals and rubrics demarcate the <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi>’s three sections: Prologue (lines 1–20), Christ’s Passion (lines 21–552), Christ’s Resurrection (lines 553–706). Smaller yet somewhat enlarged colored initials indicate stanza-like groupings of couplets. Most are four, six, or eight lines in length, and many are longer. This edition groups lines according to the positioning of the colored initials.</p>
