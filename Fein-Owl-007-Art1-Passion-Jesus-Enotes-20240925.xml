        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <note type="enote" n="1">3<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Nis hit nouht of Karlemeyne ne of </hi><hi rend="italic">the duzeper</hi>. The poet establishes the work’s opposition to secular French <hi rend="italic">chansons de geste </hi>(songs of adventure). The topos is common in Anglo-French devotional literature (<hi rend="italic">VLT</hi>, pp. 238–41). For the author — and perhaps the scribe too, because the compilation begins here — the chief adventure for humankind is Jesus’s Passion. Compare the opening of Chardri’s Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italic">Life of </hi><hi rend="italic">the Seven Sleepers</hi> (also in Jesus 29): “Gentlemen, I do not want to waste my efforts on the fables of Ovid, and I am certainly not going to say anything about Tristram nor Galeron; or waste any attention upon Renart or Hersent. I would rather talk about God and his power” (Chardri, <hi rend="italic">The Works</hi>, trans. Cartlidge, p. 42). Compare also the English poem <hi rend="italic">On Serving Christ</hi> (art. 18), which celebrates Saint Thomas in epic style; <hi rend="italic">When Holy Church Is</hi><hi rend="italic"> Under Foot</hi> (art. 12), which suggests a chivalric defense of Holy Church; and <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19), which extols spiritual love in courtly terms.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="2">5<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Al volk wes todreved, </hi><hi rend="italic">so schep beoth in the wolde</hi>. Compare Matthew 26:31 and Mark 14:27. The line is repeated in its biblical context later; see lines 133–34.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3">17<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Heo habbe scolde, and so</hi><hi rend="italic"> we muwe, ne therfth ther non adrede</hi>. “He had, and thus we have, no need to be afraid.” On Jesus as an exemplum on the fear of death, compare<ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal"> lines 153–54 (note</ref>).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4">25–26<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">After that he was . . . </hi><hi rend="italic">that hatte Seynt Johan</hi>. On Jesus’s baptism by John the Baptist, compare Matthew 3:13, Mark 1:9, and John 1:29–31.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="5">35<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">yssyng</hi>. “avarice.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">yitsinge</hi> (ger.), sense c.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6">38<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">To hwan artu </hi><hi rend="italic">ycume?</hi> This question posed by Jesus to Satan is later posed by Jesus to Judas: “To hwan ertu ycume?” (line 193). The repetition serves to directly liken Judas to Satan. On the phrase <hi rend="italic">to hwan</hi>, “why, to what purpose,” see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">whan</hi> (pron.), sense 2b.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7">27–40<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">The Holy Gost </hi><hi rend="italic">hyne ledde . . . hym to servy</hi>. On Jesus’s temptation by Satan, compare Matthew 4:1–11, Mark 1:12–13, and Luke 4:1–13. See also the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to lines 681–85</ref>, below.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8">47–48<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Seththe to luvye . . . treowe and </hi><hi rend="italic">holde</hi>. Compare the message on God’s love and commandments as found in <hi rend="italic">A Homily on Sooth Love</hi> (art. 26), lines 1, 53–58.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9">49<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">for-hwon</hi>. “why.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">for</hi><hi rend="italic">-whan</hi> (pronominal adv. and conj.), sense 1, and compare line 242.</note>

 <note type="enote" n="11">62<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">His hwile he vorleost that doth for </hi><hi rend="italic">the quede</hi>. “He loses his labor who serves the wicked.” This saying is offered as a common proverb. See Whiting W219.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="12">66<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">none robe </hi><hi rend="italic">of fowe ne of gray</hi>. “no robe of variegated or gray fur.” This phrase for a fur garment, derived from OF <hi rend="italic">vair et gris</hi> and common in Middle English verse, appears elsewhere in Jesus 29: <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (art. 3), line 357; <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi> (art. 13), line 14; and <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19), line 14. Dickins-Wilson explain that the first kind of fur comes “from the grey back and white belly of a sort of squirrel, the second from the grey back alone” (p. 197n116). See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">fou</hi> (adj. as n.), sense 2, and <hi rend="italic">grei</hi> (n.(2)), sense a.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13">65–71<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Tho he com . . . “mote he</hi><hi rend="italic"> beo.”</hi> On Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem, compare Matthew 21:8–11, Mark 11:7–11, Luke 19:36–38, and John 12:12–15.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14">73–80<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Tho he com . . . hit habbeth ymaked</hi>. On Jesus and the moneychangers in the temple, compare Matthew 21:12–13, Mark 11:15–17, Luke 19:45–46, and John 2:14–16.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="15">85<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">neyhlechet</hi>. “approached, drew near.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">neighlechen</hi> (v.), sense a, and compare <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic"> Woman of Samaria</hi> (art. 5), line 6.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="16">108<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">And the Veond him on bicom myd therylke snode</hi>. This scene of Judas taking the bread from Jesus is treated with high drama in Herman de Valenciennes’s biblical paraphrase. See <hi rend="italic">CHMS</hi>, 1:260–63 (lines 1028–45).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="17">111<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">“Thu hit </hi><hi rend="italic">seyst,” queth ure Louerd, “and dest al thine mihte.”</hi> Jesus is ordering Judas to carry out his destined part in Jesus’s own execution.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="18">119<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">irede</hi>. “ready, in order, taken care of.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">irede</hi> (adj.), from OE <hi rend="italic">geræde</hi>, with this occurence being the only example cited.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="19">133–34<space rend="indent1"/>‘<hi rend="italic">Beo </hi><hi rend="italic">the seopheorde . . .</hi><hi rend="italic"> alle beon todreved</hi>.’ Compare Matthew 26:31 and Mark 14:27. The poet cites this line in the Prologue (line 5).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="20">153–54<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Wel ouhte we . . .</hi><hi rend="italic"> we beoth here</hi><hi rend="italic">!</hi> “Well ought we be afraid if we are wise, / And conquer our sins while we are here!” The poet offers a moralizing couplet, using Jesus’s momentary fear of death as an exemplum. Compare lines 17–18.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="21">167<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">He wes on of the thre</hi>. Peter, James, and John, the three apostles who accompanied Jesus to Gethsemane, are named at line 151. See Matthew 26:37 and Mark 14:33.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="22">188<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">veollen to the</hi><hi rend="italic"> grunde</hi>. “fell to the ground.” The Jews appear to fall back slightly, making way for the interaction between Jesus and Judas. At line 195, the Jews spring up from the ground.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="23">193<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">To hwan ertu ycume?</hi> This is the same question Jesus asked of Satan earlier. The repetition seems deliberate. See <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to line 38</ref>, above.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="24">198<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Malkes</hi>. Malchus, whose ear was struck by Peter’s sword, was a servant of the Jewish high priest. See John 18:10, and compare Matthew 26:51–52, Mark 14:47, and Luke 22:50.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="25">223<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">cendal</hi>. Sendal is a costly fabric, probably of silk or linen. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">cendal</hi> (n.), sense 1.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="26">242<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">vor-hwon</hi>. See <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to line 49</ref>, above.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="27">244–46<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">the temple al tobreke . . . a new a areare</hi>. This reference to Christ’s breaking and rebuilding of Solomon’s temple in three days derives from the gospels; see Matthew 26:61, Mark 14:58, and John 2:19–20. On Solomon’s original temple (3 Kings 6–8), compare <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19), <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">line 57 (note</ref>), where its mention may allude to Henry III’s building of Westminster Abbey (1245–1269). Elsewhere in Jesus 29, King Solomon is known for his judicious sayings; see <hi rend="italic">Death’s Wither-Clench</hi> (art. 7), lines 21–24, and <hi rend="italic">The Proverbs of Alfred</hi> (art. 24), lines 217–18, 274.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="28">269<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">therof thu nym gome</hi>. “pay attention to it.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">gome</hi> (n.(4)), sense 1b, which cites this line.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="29">272–74<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Blyndfellede and spatten . . . Constu hit </hi><hi rend="italic">arede?</hi> This moment of Christ’s torture was often pictured by medieval writers and artists as a cruel game of blindman’s bluff. Compare enactments in medieval drama, for example, “The Buffeting,” in <hi rend="italic">The Towneley Plays</hi>, lines 497–99 (ed. Epp, pp. 257, 477n498).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="30">277–98<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Peter stod bi the </hi><hi rend="italic">fur . . . He wes sori-mod</hi>. The scene of Peter’s denials of Christ is treated with intense theatrical drama in Herman de Valenciennes’s biblical paraphrase. See <hi rend="italic">CHMS</hi>, 1:276–81 (lines 1346–1407).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="31">89–299<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">At </hi><hi rend="italic">the Schere Thursday . . . and bigon to wepe</hi>. The paraphrased account of the Last Supper, Judas’s betrayal, the seizure of Jesus, and Peter’s denials are based on Matthew 26, Mark 14, Luke 22, John 13, and John 18:1–27.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="32">364<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">And heo wel atholdeth, and leggeth ine hord</hi>. “And heed them well, and store them up.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">at-holden</hi> (v.), sense 3, “(sth.) fix in mind, heed; to grasp, comprehend.” On the phrase <hi rend="italic">leggeth ine hord</hi>, see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">hord</hi> (n.(1)), sense 1b(a), “store or keep (words, etc.) for reference.”</note>

The word also means “innocent, blameless” (sense 1a), a meaning also appropriate here.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="34">379<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">knyhtes</hi>. The Roman soldiers are consistently called “knights,” which may reflect some attempt at creating a romance ambience. Muir comments that the poet, in noting that “this is not a tale of Charlemagne and his knights,” inserts some “qualities of a romance, as, for example, in the dramatic emphasis on action, the emotional telling of the betrayal and suffering, the participating Roman ‘knights,’ and the direct dialogue” (<hi rend="italic">MWME</hi>, 2:393–94). In the French sermon of Thomas of Hales (author of <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19)), Jesus is mocked by “les cheualers paens” (pagan knights) (Legge, ed., “The Anglo-Norman Sermon,” p. 216).</note>

 <note type="enote" n="36">424<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">sixte tide</hi>. “sixth hour.” The time of day follows John 19:14. See also Matthew 27:45, Mark 15:33, and Luke 23:44. Another reference to time, at lines 477–78, is likewise biblical, but one at line 657 is not. There may be distant allusions to the canonical hours (matins, lauds, prime, tierce, sext, none, vespers, compline), which, in prayers and devotions found in books of hours, were frequently keyed to the events of the Passion. In a pious French text of this type found in MS Harley 2253, <hi rend="italic">Seven Hours of the Passion of Jesus Christ</hi> (<hi rend="italic">CHMS</hi>, 3:298–305, 363–64), the moment when Pilate relinquished Jesus to his Jewish accusers corresponds to tierce.

 <note type="enote" n="38">434<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">bouhte us myd his blode</hi>. Medieval Christian doctrine held that God’s sacrifice of his incarnate son Jesus Christ, who died on the Cross, was an act of love that redeemed humankind from its sinful fallen state. Thereafter, human souls could repent, seek God’s grace, and hope to enter heaven. The bloody sacrifice is seen as a “buying” of human souls out of an otherwise certain fate in hell.</note>

 <note type="enote" n="40">478<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">midden-herde</hi>. “earth, world,” literally “middle-earth,” the term for the whole world of people, as perceived to exist between heaven and hell. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">middel-erd</hi> (n.).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="41">477–78<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">mydday . . . thet hit wes non</hi>. On darkness falling at the “ninth hour,” see Matthew 27:45, Mark 15:33, and Luke 23:44. Compare <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to line 424</ref>, above.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="42">513<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">hwelfde</hi>. “rolled,” a meaning attested only here. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">whelven</hi> (v.), sense 1b, “to move (a stone) by rolling it over and over,” and compare Mark 15:46.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="43">300–531<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Theyh he hedde . . . upe </hi><hi rend="italic">thene ston</hi>. The paraphrased account of Jesus on trial before Pilate and the Crucifixion are based on Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23, John 18:28–40, and John 19. Compare also <hi rend="italic">The Gospel of Nicodemus</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">CHMS</hi>, 1:314–33.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="44">536<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Ne</hi>. “Immediately, now.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">nou</hi> (adv.), sense 2, where the erroneous spelling <hi rend="italic">ne</hi> is listed. The word cannot be the negative conjunction for there is no other negative word in the sentence. An interrupted syntax emphasizes the ironic, divine purpose in conjoined actions of creation and destruction: God created all things, and in this moment destroys hell’s door. The Jews, meanwhile, plot irrationally to overcome one who is all-powerful.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="45">547<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Bidde we</hi>. In the Jesus sequence of poems, many closing stanzas open with this phrase, which signals a final prayer. Because the first letter <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is always a red capital, these worshipful endings are quite noticeable to a reader of the manuscript. Compare <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (art. 3), line 389; <hi rend="italic">The </hi><hi rend="italic">Saws of Saint Bede</hi> (art. 4), line 349; <hi rend="italic">The Annunciation</hi> (art. 10), line 4; <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi> (art. 13), line 41; and <hi rend="italic">Fire and Ice</hi> (art. 21), line 2.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="46">547–52<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Bidde we </hi><hi rend="italic">alle . . . of lykamlyche bende</hi>. This section ends with a prayer that reminds the audience to confess and thereby repel the Devil. Throughout the poems of Jesus 29, the sacrament of confession (<hi rend="italic">scrift</hi>) is stressed as a crucial precondition for the soul’s salvation, in accord with dictates of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) requiring, at minimum, annual confession of all Christians. This decree caused a great expansion in pastoral care to the laity. On the vital importance of confession for salvation, a preacherly imperative throughout the lyrics of Jesus 29, compare <hi rend="italic">The Eleven Pains of Hell</hi> (art. 28), line 189; and see <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">the headnotes to <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi></ref> and <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal"><hi rend="italic">A Homily on Sooth Love</hi></ref> (arts. 3, 26).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="47">576<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">leyhtunward</hi>. “gardener,” a meaning attested only here. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">leigh-toun</hi> (n.), sense 1b, and compare John 20:15.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="48">586<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">heore</hi>. “what’s his.” The translation “his own” follows Morris, who reads <hi rend="italic">heore</hi> as the genitive of <hi rend="italic">he</hi>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="49"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">ever ilyche</hi>. “unceasingly, constantly, invariably.” For this phrase, see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">iliche</hi> (adv.), sense 3, and <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> (adv.), sense 9.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="50">607<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Hondleth</hi>. “Observe, consider.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">hondlen</hi> (v.), sense 3c. The primary sense of <hi rend="italic">hondlen</hi> is “touch, feel, grasp,” so it is possible that Jesus is inviting the disciples to touch him in this scene, which perhaps alludes to when Jesus allowed Thomas to touch his side-wound (John 20:27).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="51">611<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Yet heo hit ny </hi><hi rend="italic">levede, the more ne the lesse</hi>. “But they believed it not, neither more nor less (that is, not at all).” For this construction, <hi rend="italic">the more ne the </hi><hi rend="italic">lesse</hi>, see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ne</hi> (conj.(1)), sense 2b(d), where this line is cited.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="52">629–32<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">“Theo that ye . . . wyteth ye myd iwisse.”</hi> Jesus declares the doctrine of salvation: those who are released from their sins will go to heaven; those bound to their worldly sins will remain fettered in hell. The lines are based on John 20:21–23: “He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you. When he said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="53">553–642<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Seoththe Crist</hi><hi rend="italic"> from dethe aros . . . therafter ful sone</hi>. The paraphrased account of Mary Magdalene at Jesus’s tomb and the Resurrection is based largely on John 20; see also Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="54">645–46<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">twei veyre men . . . myd hwite clothes</hi>. The two fair men in white are angels, as described in the Bible: “And she saw two angels in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid” (John 20:12). See also Luke 24:23.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="55">657<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Witsuneday</hi>. Whitsunday, based on the original Pentecost (depicted here, when the apostles received the Holy Ghost). In the church calendar it is celebrated the seventh Sunday after Easter.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="56">668<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Everuych ther</hi><hi rend="italic"> understod his icunde speche</hi>. This detail from the pentecostal story seems relevant to the overall preaching in English verse found in Jesus 29. Note too the mention in the <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Saint Thomas the Martyr in English</hi> (art. 17) that this native saint is of special help to the English because he readily understands English prayers (lines 7–8).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="57">657–72<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">At thon heye undarne . . . then heoveliche kyng</hi>. These lines paraphrase Acts 2:1–8. For the phrase <hi rend="italic">heye undarne</hi>, see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">undern</hi> (n.), “the third hour of the day, 9 a.m.; mid-morning,” with <hi rend="italic">heigh undern</hi> defined as the hour between 9 and 10 a.m. No time of day is specified in the Bible. On the marking of time in <hi rend="italic">The Passion of Jesus Christ</hi>, see <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to line 424</ref>, above.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="58">681–85<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Thervore the</hi><hi rend="italic"> Veond . . . myd his ycorene</hi>. The language applied here to Satan closely reflects that used for the Jews in the Passion narrative. The Jews had envy and always sought ways to bring Jesus to death; compare lines 57, 81–88, 392. The <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> poet frames the narrative of Christ’s Passion with mentions of the existential reality of Satan’s malice in the world: at the beginning, in Satan’s temptation of Christ (lines 27–40), and here in this prayer.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="59">686<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Nerun</hi>. Nero Claudius Caesar, Roman emperor (37–68), notorious for his tyranny, cruelty, extravagance, and persecution of Christians.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="60"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Dacyen</hi>. Probably Trajan Decius, Roman emperor (249–51), who reigned too late to have killed the apostles, but was a scourge to Christians. The miraculous sleep in Chardri’s <hi rend="italic">Life of the Seven Sleepers</hi> (one of Jesus 29’s Anglo-French texts) begins in the time of Decius (Chardri, <hi rend="italic">The Works</hi>, trans. Cartlidge, p. 42). In Jacobus de Voragine’s <hi rend="italic">Golden Legend</hi>, the martyrdom of Saint Lawrence is ascribed to Decius Caesar (trans. Ryan, 2:67). Lawrence is commemorated elsewhere in Jesus 29: <hi rend="italic">On Serving Christ</hi> (art. 18), lines 44–47.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="61">690<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">That is heore mede vor heore prechinge</hi>. Friars modeled themselves on the apostolic mission of preaching, and this line seems to affirm the fraternal estate.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="62">697–702<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">And he </hi><hi rend="italic">that . . . ut of lyve thisse</hi>. The poet asks God’s blessing for himself and his “ordre” (line 700). The lines strongly suggest that the author was a friar or canon, and that composition occurred “within some sort of religious order” (Cartlidge-Composition, p. 258). Compare prayers for the writer or scribe that close <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (art. 3), lines 389–90; and <hi rend="italic">The Eleven Pains of Hell</hi> (art. 28), lines 283–91.</note>
