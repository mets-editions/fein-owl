        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-011-Art2-Owl-Nightingale-Enotes"/><div type="text">
 <note type="enote" n="1">incipit<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Incipit altercatio inter filomenam et bubonem</hi>. In contrast to the poem’s traditional title, <hi rend="italic">The Owl and the Nightingale</hi>, the title given in the scribe’s rubric is <hi rend="italic">Debate between the Nightingale and the Owl</hi>. The well-known title is from line 4: “An ule and one nyhtegale.” In Cotton, there is no rubric. In the lost Tichfield Abbey, MS Q.III, the title is identical to the Latin incipit of Jesus 29. The late thirteenth century witnessed the rise of a genre of devotional passion meditations termed “nightingales” directed toward wealthy patrons, and, if in the vernacular, toward women like Queen Eleanor of Provence, wife of Henry III and widow after 1372. The title might therefore be a clue as to genre: a nightingale poem “draws diverse materials into a single harmony” (<hi rend="italic">VLT</hi>, p. 204). The tradition is best represented in the Anglo-French <hi rend="italic">Rossignos</hi> (1268–1275) by John of Howden (Queen Eleanor’s clerk and religious advisor) and two Anglo-Latin poems, both titled <hi rend="italic">Philomena</hi>, by John of Howden and John Pecham. Wogan-Browne traces the tradition from <hi rend="italic">Rossignos</hi> to John Lydgate’s <hi rend="italic">Nightingale</hi>, and suggests that the early Middle English <hi rend="italic">Thrush and the Nightingale</hi> (contemporary with <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>) springs from it (“The Tongues of the Nightingale”). See also Reed, <hi rend="italic">Middle English Debate Poetry</hi>, pp. 245–46. The meditative nightingale genre deserves closer attention in regard to the cultural origin of <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi> and its placement in Jesus 29 after <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> (art. 1). See the discussion in the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">Introduction to this volume (pp. 16–17)</ref>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="2">1<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">in one sumere dale</hi>. “in a valley in summer.” The poem opens with an eavesdropping narrator who is out enjoying a natural setting specifed by landscape and season, as in numerous vernacular lyrics (<hi rend="italic">chansons d’aventure</hi>). On the grammatical and translational challenge of the phrase <hi rend="italic">sumere dale</hi>, see Stanley, p. 105n1; and Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, p. 106n1. Because trees are said to be in bloom, Millett translates <hi rend="italic">sumere</hi> as “springtime.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3">4<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">An ule and one nyhtegale</hi>. “an owl and a nightingale.” Cartlidge comments, “The poetic conjunction of owls with nightingales is not unnatural, since both birds are traditionally identified as nocturnal singers” (Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, p. 96), and he provides excerpts from several texts that precede and might have influenced <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, including St. Ambrose’s <hi rend="italic">Hexaemeron</hi>, a sermon by Maximus of Turin, and Theodulf of Orléans’s <hi rend="italic">Carmen 27</hi> (Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, pp. 96–98). The English bird-name <hi rend="italic">nightingale</hi> is first recorded in <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>; it also appears as a surname around 1275; see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">nightin-gale</hi> (n.).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4">14<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">beche</hi>. “beech trees.” Alternatively, the word could mean a “forest clearing”; Cotton reads <hi rend="italic">breche</hi>. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> beche</hi> (n.), sense 1a, compared to <hi rend="italic">bach</hi> (n.(1)), sense 1a. The variants are discussed by Stanley, p. 105n13f; and Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, p. 107n14.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="5">17<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">vaste</hi>. “thick, impenetrable.” Cotton reads <hi rend="italic">waste</hi>, “deserted.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6">20<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">a veole cunne wyse</hi>. “in many ways” or “a range of tunes.” See <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to line 54</ref>, below.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7">26<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">song hire tyde</hi>. “sang her hours.” This reference initiates an ongoing poetic association of the owl and her music with the Church. The sonorific image of a bird singing hours evokes the “set of observances (combining psalms, prayers, and hymns) recited at regular intervals throughout the day, the ‘canonical hours’ of Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, Nones, Vespers, and Compline. Secular clerics and members of religious orders followed the complex observances of the full Divine Office; the pious laity in this period might also observe the Hours as a private devotion” (Millett, n26). See also Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, p. 47n26, and compare <hi rend="italic">The Passion of Jesus Christ</hi> (art. 1), <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">line 424 (note)</ref>. On the musical competition between the birds, see especially Allen, “The Voices”; Holsinger, “Vernacular Legality,” pp. 171–82; and Page, <hi rend="italic">The Owl and the Nightingale</hi>, pp. 3–6. John Pecham’s thirteenth-century <hi rend="italic">Philomena</hi>, a meditation on Christ’s Passion, is structured as the nightingale’s songs set at different canonical hours (Bestul, <hi rend="italic">Texts of the Passion</hi>, p. 102).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8">35<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wle lete</hi>. “awful face.” For <hi rend="italic">wle</hi>, read <hi rend="italic">vule</hi>, “evil, vile, ugly”; the orthography of <hi rend="italic">w</hi> for <hi rend="italic">vu</hi> is common in both the Jesus and Cotton texts of <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>. On <hi rend="italic">lete</hi>, “face,” compare <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ilete</hi> (n.), senses 1a “outward manner or bearing,” and 1b “expression.” This Old Norse-derived word appears only in <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>; compare lines 403, 1446, 1715.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9">37<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">falt my tunge</hi>. “my speech fails.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">folden</hi> (v.(2)), sense 2b, which cites this line. Compare <hi rend="italic">Signs of Death</hi> (art. 22), line 4.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="10">38<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Hwenne thu art to me ithrunge</hi>. “When you press close to me.” A nightingale’s refusal to sing when perched too close to a hawk appears in the fable of The Hawk and the Nightingale, told in Anglo-Norman by Marie de France (<hi rend="italic">Fables</hi>, ed. and trans. Spiegel, pp. 178–79), and in Latin by Romulus. See excerpts in Stanley, p. 164; and Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, pp. 98–99.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="11">44<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">That wel neyh hire fnast atset</hi>. “She could barely breathe,” literally “That barely could she pass her breath.” The verb is attested only in <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>; see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">atsheten</hi> (v.), “of breath, life: pass out or away, be gone from (sb.),” and compare line 1623.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="12">48<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wrytelinge</hi>. “warbling, twittering”; <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> writelinge</hi> (ger.). The word appears in <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi> two times, and nowhere else. See also line 914.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13">54<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wise</hi>. “tune, melody.” As Stanley notes, “Both meanings, ‘manner’ and ‘tune’, fit the context, but the latter is perhaps to be preferred” (p. 106n54). See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">wis(e)</hi> (n.(2)), “way, manner,” and <hi rend="italic">wis(e)</hi> (n.(3)), “melody, song”; compare lines 20, 519, 1663, and 1703.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14">57<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">blete</hi>. “exposure.” This noun is attested only in <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">blet</hi> (adj. and n.), sense 1b, “bareness, lack of cover.” Compare line 616.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="15">65–68<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Vorthi thu art loth . . . </hi><hi rend="italic">narewe the byledeth</hi>. The medieval <hi rend="italic">Bestiary</hi> notes the tendency of other birds to mob the screech-owl, allegorizing this action as wholesome hostility against a sinner: “If other birds see it, they set up a great clamour, and it is vexed by their fierce onslaughts. So when a sinner is recognised in full daylight he becomes an object of mockery for the righteous” (trans. Barber, p. 149). In the cathedrals of Gloucester and Norwich, one may still find carved medieval misericords that depict an owl swarmed by numerous smaller birds. See, for example, the Gloucester Cathedral owl misericord, online at <ref target="https://misericords.co.uk/images/Gloucester/Gloucester%209.3.jpg" type="external">https://misericords.co.uk/images/Gloucester/Gloucester%209.3.jpg</ref>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="16">69<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">forthe</hi>. “that’s why, for that reason, therefore.” The word is the same as <hi rend="italic">Vorthi</hi> in line 65, and grammatically parallel to it.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="17">76<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wode</hi>. “a blue dye of vegetable origin.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> wod(e)</hi> (n.(1)), sense 1a.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="18">86<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">That sit at mulne under cogge</hi>. Stanley, p. 107n86, notes how a frog dwells under a millwheel cog in Marie de France’s fable of The Mouse and the Frog (<hi rend="italic">Fables</hi>, ed. and trans. Spiegel, pp. 34–41), but the resemblance is slight: the frog in the fable merely visits a mouse there, and then entices the mouse to visit a swamp.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="19">91<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Thu art lodlich and unclene</hi>. The medieval <hi rend="italic">Bestiary</hi> notes that the screech-owl fouls its own nest, comparing it to sinners: “It is known as a loathsome bird because its roost is filthy from its droppings, just as the sinner brings all who dwell with him into disrepute through the example of his dishonourable behaviour” (trans. Barber, <hi rend="italic">Bestiary</hi>, p. 149).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="20">99–100<space rend="indent1"/>‘<hi rend="italic">Dehaet habbe that ilke best / That fuleth his</hi><hi rend="italic"> owe nest</hi>.’ “Shame on that creature / Who soils its own nest.” This is a common proverb (Whiting B306) that appears in many different languages in many medieval literary texts, including a Latin translation of Nicholas Bozon’s fable of The Hawk and the Owl (ca. 1350–1400). See commentary in Atkins, pp. 10–11n99–100; Stanley, pp. 107n99f, 160, 162, 164; and Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, p. 50n99–100.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="21">121<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">myd</hi><hi rend="italic"> the vyrste</hi>. “first of all, right away.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> first</hi> (ord. num. (as adj. &amp; n.)), sense 5a(c). The Cotton reading is more emphatic and more colorful: <hi rend="italic">mid þe </hi><hi rend="italic">alre wrste</hi>, “with the worst muck of all” (Stanley, p. 107n121f).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="22">101–26<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">That other yer</hi><hi rend="italic"> . . . crowe hit todrowe</hi>. The funny story of an ugly, ill-mannered owl chick in a falcon’s nest appears in the popular fable of The Hawk and the Owl, retold in collections by Romulus, Nicholas Bozon, and Marie de France (<hi rend="italic">Fables</hi>, trans. Speigel, pp. 212–13). It appears, too, in Odo of Cheriton’s fable of The Buzzard and the Hawk’s Nest, where a buzzard is the hideous one (Odo of Cheriton, <hi rend="italic">The Fables</hi>, trans. and ed. Jacobs, p. 75). Summaries of the different versions are printed by Stanley, pp. 159, 164; and Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, pp. 99–101.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="23">131<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">freomonne</hi>. “free gentry, worthy men.” Compare line 1507; and see <hi rend="italic">Weal</hi> (art. 6), <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">line 3 (note)</ref>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="24">127–38<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Therby men seggeth . . . </hi><hi rend="italic">he is icume</hi>. This exemplum of the apple rolling away from its tree of origin appears in versions of the fable of The Hawk and the Owl told by Marie de France and Nicholas Bozon. See Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, pp. 99–101. On the proverb of lines 135–38 (Whiting A169), see further commentary in Atkins, pp. 14–15n135–8; Stanley, pp. 107n135,138, 160, 162; and Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, p. 51n135–8.</note>

The name has been traditionally taken to refer to King Henry II (d. 1189); line 1092 indicates that the king is now dead (Stanley, pp. 131–32n1091f.). According to Millett, <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi> “is likely to date from before 1216, the accession of Henry III. Henry II, as a patron of courtly literature (including the <hi rend="italic">Lais</hi> of Marie de France), could be seen as an appropriate supporter for the nightingale” (n1091). Cartlidge argues plausibly, however, for a much later date, not very distant from the making of the Cotton and Jesus manuscripts, with the reference being to Henry III (d. 1272) or to a fictitious king (Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, pp. 75–76); for the argument in full detail, see Cartlidge, “The Date.” Compare the complimentary references to Henry III that appear in <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19), <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">lines 41 (note)</ref>,<ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal"> 51 (note)</ref>.

Others have understood the line to refer more broadly to “All socially respectable people, lay or clerical, but not the poor, nor the peasantry (nor, for that matter, monks),” that is, those who “wore linen (i.e., underclothing)” (Stanley, p. 134n1174).

This early instance of a “parliament” of birds is of great literary interest, particularly in comparison to Chaucer’s much-later <hi rend="italic">Parliament of Fowls</hi>.

Bishop Grosseteste in the first half of the 13th century tried to put an end to these abuses” (p. 150n1775ff.). Yet the practice of granting multiple livings was so common as to be rather ordinary, and it is difficult to gauge whether it is regarded here as an abuse or as a proper way to reward Nicholas. See discussions by Stanley, p. 158n1773–76; and by Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, p. 94n1759–68, who argues that if Nicholas was trained in law (line 1756), the poem can best be dated in the period from the 1230s to the 1320s.

As Cartlidge comments, “The request that Nicholas should be better paid is hardly likely to have succeeded, unless his patrons were able to appreciate the poem’s impudence as an aspect of its wit” (Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, p. 95n1777–80).

In this respect, the evidence made available to him for judging between the two birds is no different (at least in form) from that provided to the readers or hearers of the poem” (Cartlidge-<hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, p. 95n1781–88). This observation is not quite true, however, for the owl’s recitation of the speeches would necessarily omit the narrator’s voice, which sometimes depicts the disputants’ emotional reactions and mental ruminations. Nonetheless, the idea that the poem just read is the verbatim transcript to be recited before Nicholas renders <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi> akin to <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi>, which becomes the actual writ (a “rune” or song) to be drawn out and read (or sung) repeatedly by the “maid of Christ”; see <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19),<ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal"> line 102 (note).</ref></note>
