        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-018-Art4-Saws-Bede-Headnote"/><div type="text">
 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1"><hi rend="italic">The Saws of Saint Bede</hi> survives in two versions in two manuscripts. It has no title in Jesus 29, but its scribal rubric in the second copy is <hi rend="italic">Þe Sawe of Seint Bede Prest</hi>. That name is found in the important trilingual miscellany Oxford, BodL, MS Digby 86 (Worcestershire, ca. 1280), fol. 127va, a volume that also preserves copies of <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Death</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The Eleven Pains of Hell</hi> (arts. 13, 14, 28). A <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> is a “saying,” and the medieval title marks this poem as belonging to the vernacular genre of proverb collections attributed to a famous sage, such as <hi rend="italic">Hending</hi> (<hi rend="italic">CHMS</hi>, 3:220–37, 334–37) and <hi rend="italic">The Proverbs of Alfred</hi> (art. 24). The Venerable Bede (672–735) was a revered English saint, religious scholar, and monkish author of <hi rend="italic">An Ecclesiastical History of England</hi>, whose authority is cited elsewhere in Jesus 29 (<hi rend="italic">Ten Abuses</hi> (art. 15), line 13).</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">Previously edited just once each, the two versions’ existence under different titles has muddied awareness and recognition of a vigorous poem of moral warning, enlivened by clever estates satire and a scene of God’s examination of souls on Judgment Day. Early editors named the Jesus copy <hi rend="italic">Sinners Beware!</hi> (Morris in 1872), and the Digby one <hi rend="italic">The Sayings of St. Bede</hi> (Frederick J. Furnivall in 1901). The later Digby copy is somewhat longer (373 lines compared to 354), lacks four stanzas found in Jesus 29, and possesses seven new ones. The fifty-five stanzas that agree are largely in the same order. Hence, the two copies are near-identical versions of the same poem. Although <hi rend="italic">NIMEV</hi> and <hi rend="italic">DIMEV</hi> list <hi rend="italic">Sinners Beware!</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Saws</hi> separately, Cameron Louis names them as one work, <hi rend="italic">The Saws of </hi><hi rend="italic">Saint Bede</hi> (<hi rend="italic">MWME</hi>, 9:3041). I give this context in order to explain my decision to name the Jesus 29 poem according to its traditional, and medieval, Digby title. Although the Venerable Bede is never named in <hi rend="italic">Saws</hi>, his reputation for sagacity does crop up in Jesus 29: see <hi rend="italic">Ten Abuses</hi> (art. 15), line 13. Like the oft-mentioned King Alfred, Bede represents proverbial wisdom and moral rectitude welling from a reservoir of ancient, native authority.</p>
 <p style="body" n="2">The poem opens with a long prayer that invokes the Trinity (Holy Ghost, Christ, and Creator) to protect us from the Devil (lines 1–24). Then the speaker urges that “makie we us clene and skere [<hi rend="italic">pure</hi>]” before we die so that we may dwell with angels (lines 25–30). Although no tongue may express hell, it is nonetheless described in brief strokes (lines 25–72), comparable to the fuller description found in <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (art. 3). To avoid hell, we must repent, forsake sin, and confess. The Seven Sins are then loosely enumerated (line 73–90) before the speaker turns to the uncertain fates faced by all. He now enumerates different estates, inserting apt details that match living occupations to each practitioner’s eventual doom (lines 91–180). The estates include rich and poor, monks and priests, knights and lawyers, merchants and bondsmen, fine ladies and nuns. Unfortunately, the poet says, we may not know when we will die (lines 181–92). He contrasts the equally dire fates of the doomed soul and body: one travels to pain; the other rots all alone. We come in weeping and naked, and so do we leave (lines 193–216). We must therefore subdue sin with prayer and alms, but, sadly, some fail to confess out of shame. Later, however, it will be worse: each sinner will go to the pains of hell and then be judged, so confess now (lines 216–58). When Doomsday comes, God will speak directly to each side, calling out the Seven Works of Mercy (lines 259–324). The damned souls will curse their bodies, and the “clene,” saved souls (who passed God’s test of mercy) will feel no compassion for the punished ones (lines 331–42). In the end, the poet affirms that virtuous souls will dwell with angels (lines 343–54).</p>
 <p style="body" n="3">The Jesus 29 scribe copied the tail-rhyme stanzas of <hi rend="italic">The </hi><hi rend="italic">Saws of Saint Bede</hi> in an unusually graphic way, spreading each stanza across two columns, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-rhymes on the left, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>-rhymes on the right. Red tie-lines connect each <hi rend="italic">aab</hi> grouping, and a colored initial letter marks off each 6-line stanza. Daniel Wakelin points to the layout of <hi rend="italic">Saws</hi> as an example of how early Middle English scribes experimented with ways to present new verse forms on the page, probably with a strong sense that rhymes and meters were designed for being recited aloud and heard (<hi rend="italic">Designing English</hi>, pp. 138–39). According to Pearsall, the tail-rhyme form of <hi rend="italic">Saws</hi> was derived from Latin models (<hi rend="italic">Old and Middle English Poetry</hi>, p. 97). No other poem in Jesus 29 is composed in tail-rhyme verse, and no other poem has such a strikingly inventive layout on the page. The text of <hi rend="italic">Saws</hi> is presented in this edition with deep indentations for the <hi rend="italic">b</hi>-rhyme lines, which encourages the kind of reading with measured pauses that the scribe’s dramatic graphic layout requires.</p>
