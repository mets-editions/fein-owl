        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1"><hi rend="italic">The Woman of Samaria</hi> is a biblical paraphrase of John 4:4–30 with virtually no homiletic content. As a gospel-based retelling, it may be compared with <hi rend="italic">The Passion of Jesus Christ in English</hi> (art. 1), but there are strong differences. While <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> recounts a universally understood sequence of events, well known not only from the gospels but also from the apocryphal <hi rend="italic">Gospel of Nicodemus</hi>, and its sacred narrative forms the foundation of redemptive theology, <hi rend="italic">The Woman </hi><hi rend="italic">of Samaria</hi> selects a passage of the Bible rarely highlighted on its own.</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">The reason for its inclusion is not apparent. Perhaps it was composed as a reading for a church service or for a specifically female audience. What it adds to the lyric collection in Jesus 29 is a surprising interest in a biblical woman who interacted with Jesus. The <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> concludes with Mary Magdalene’s moving encounter with the resurrected Lord (lines 554–94). In like manner, this paraphrase highlights the Samaritan’s woman’s earnest discourse with Jesus. The manner of telling conveys Jesus’s humility, mercy, and quiet authority, expressed with disarming simplicity and homely intimacy.</p>
 <p style="body" n="2">The main theological import of the paraphrase is the revelation of Jesus as the Messiah, the woman’s immediate and total faith in this truth, and the lesson Jesus gives her about prayer and salvation (lines 51–54). Jesus’s gentle admonition about the woman’s number of husbands (lines 33–36) is merely paraphrased without comment, and there is none of the misogyny given to the passage by Jerome and defended against by the Wife of Bath (see <hi rend="italic">The Riverside Chaucer</hi>, pp. 864–65). Jesus, born of Mary (line 3), unpretentiously speaks alone with a sexualized, foreign woman, and the apostles are astounded (lines 61–62). Yet the key import seems to be that what he said to her he had already said to them (they did not marvel at the content; line 63), and that here the redemptive, merciful Word spreads outward beyond a Jewish, male community.</p>
