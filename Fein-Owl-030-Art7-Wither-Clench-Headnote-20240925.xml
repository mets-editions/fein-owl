        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-030-Art7-Wither-Clench-Headnote"/><div type="text">
 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">Following a complex 10-line stanzaic rhyme scheme, this five-stanza lyric on death appears beside music in one of its five manuscripts, so it evidently circulated as a song. Given its “rather grisly character” (Reese, <hi rend="italic">Music in the Middle Ages</hi>, p. 242), the mood it conveys is one of misery: each stanza’s seventh line opens with the woeful exclamation “Wailaway!” Many lines call directly to “Mon,” chiding him for how oblivious he is to death. The listener or congregant singer is reminded to be prepared for death’s unlooked-for, inauspicious, sudden appearance. Death in personified form enters stealthily in four stanzas, offering its potion, striking a violent blow, lurking in one’s shoe, and tossing one down from a height. In the final stanza, it is the World that deceives a man and keeps him unprepared for death. As in many other Jesus 29 lyrics, Solomon is named as a wise authority, here on the subject of death (line 21).</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">In Jesus 29 and Cotton Caligula A.ix, <hi rend="italic">Death’s Wither-Clench</hi> precedes <hi rend="italic">An Orison to Our Lady</hi> (art. 8). Dobson and Harrison have noted, interestingly, that both poems can be sung to the same music, which they provide from the Maidstone MS (<hi rend="italic">Medieval English Songs</hi>, pp. 131, 243). It seems very likely, therefore, that the medieval audience of Jesus and Cotton would have recognized these lyrics as paired songs. The two poems may in fact be <hi rend="italic">contrafacta</hi>, that is, one a transformation of the subject matter and style of the other. The direction for this activity was usually secular to religious, which would suggest, in this case, that <hi rend="italic">Death’s Wither-Clench</hi> is the somewhat older poem (and that it was viewed as more generally admonitive than religious). This possibility makes it all the more fascinating that <hi rend="italic">An Orison to Our Lady</hi> retains intimations of death in its tones of Marian worship.</p>
 <p style="body" n="2"><hi rend="italic">Death’s Wither-Clench</hi> appears often in anthologies of Middle English verse, sometimes under the title <hi rend="italic">Long Life</hi> and sometimes under the first line <hi rend="italic">Man may longe lives weene</hi>. Titles have varied because the word <hi rend="italic">wither-clench</hi>, “counter-grip” (line 12) appears in only two versions of the poem (Maidstone and Laud), while Jesus and Cotton bear the word <hi rend="italic">wither-blench</hi>, “counter-trick.” But an unfixed title creates the false impression that the two poems are different, while in fact they are the same one: a lyric mourning Death’s cold grip and strategic tricks, sung to a tune that survives. By naming the Jesus/Cotton song <hi rend="italic">Death’s Wither-Clench</hi>, I seek here to standardize the title by selecting the one of most color and familiarity. In the bibliographical summary given below, I provide only a select listing of editions based on manuscripts other than Jesus 29. For a fuller overview, see <hi rend="italic">DIMEV</hi> 3370. Three of the four other versions of <hi rend="italic">Death</hi><hi rend="italic">’s Wither-Clench</hi> may be viewed by digital facsimile.
