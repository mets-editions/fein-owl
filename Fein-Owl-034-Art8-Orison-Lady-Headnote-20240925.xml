        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-034-Art8-Orison-Lady-Headnote"/><div type="text">
 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">Like the preceding <hi rend="italic">Death’s Wither-Clench</hi> (art. 7), this Marian prayer has five 10-line stanzas rhyming on two sounds, but the rhyme scheme is different. Because the speaker mentions song twice (lines 2, 8), it may also have been sung, but no musical score has survived. Dobson and Harrison propose that it was sung to the same tune as <hi rend="italic">Death’s Wither-Clench</hi>, which they provide (<hi rend="italic">Medieval English Songs</hi>, pp. 131, 243). In syntax, the stanzas of <hi rend="italic">An Orison </hi><hi rend="italic">to Our Lady</hi> turn at the sixth line, with phrases echoed in stanzas 1–2 (“Heo brouhte”) and in stanzas 3–4 (“Tharfore ich thenche”).</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">Despite heaping praise upon Mary, the speaker’s mind dwells persistently on the threat of death and eternal punishment. He prays in optimistic hope of Mary’s ability to provide remedy from hell’s pains because of her blessed childbearing. Contrasted to Eve’s darkness, she is bright light, good health, and joyous happiness. Foolishly deluded by the World’s attractions, the speaker pledges to forsake sin and let Mary guide him. The song ends in repentant near-desperation, asking Mary, surprisingly, to take vengeance on him (“Awrec thu nu on me, Levedi”) before Death seizes him (lines 43–45). Mary is thus addressed as a direct agent in the petitioner’s salvation: the poem ends by crying out to her, not God, for retribution followed by mercy.</p>
 <p style="body" n="2">Praise and worship of Mary appear frequently in the verse of Jesus 29. Other Marian lyrics include <hi rend="italic">The Five Joys </hi><hi rend="italic">of Our Lady Saint Mary</hi> (art. 11) and the two fragmentary Annunciation lyrics (arts. 10, 20). In addition, other works express Marian veneration as an assumed component of their religious focus; see, in particular, <hi rend="italic">When Holy Church Is Under Foot</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (arts. 12, 13, 19). A more general interest in Jesus’s interactions with women surfaces in <hi rend="italic">The </hi><hi rend="italic">Passion of Jesus Christ</hi> (art. 1) (the meeting with Mary Magdalene) and <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Samaria</hi> (art. 5).</p>
 <p style="body" n="3">The Jesus 29 copy of this poem lacks the final nineteen lines because the leaf that originally followed folio 180 has been lost. Missing lines 22, 32–50 are here supplied from the near-identical text that survives in MS Cotton Caligula A.ix. The lyric has appeared often in anthologies of Middle English verse. The summary given below offers a select listing of the editions based on Cotton Caligula A.ix or on Cambridge, TCC, MS B.14.39; for a fuller overview of the publication history, see <hi rend="italic">DIMEV</hi> 4270.
