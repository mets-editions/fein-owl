        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-051-Art12-Under-Foot-Enotes"/><div type="text">
 <note type="enote" n="1">2–3<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Tho queth ure Louerd . . . </hi><hi rend="italic">sette the upon</hi>. For Christ’s words to the apostle Peter, see Matthew 16:18: “That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="2">6<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wurthsype</hi>. This word, repeated at line 24, bears a double meaning, one straightforwardly about the Church as the center of worship, and the other about Holy Church figured as a woman whose chastity is threatened or abused. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi> <hi rend="italic">worship(e)</hi> (n.), sense 1e, “a woman’s honor, perceived virtue, her reputation for chastity, modesty, etc.”; and the ecclesiastical meanings gathered under sense 2, for example, “(b) the veneration offered to that which is regarded as holy or sacred, devout reverence directed toward a deity, a person, an institution, object, etc.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3">7<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">symonye</hi>. The wordplay is upon the Peter’s alternate name Simon; see John 1:42.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4">13<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Clement</hi>. Saint Clement, Bishop of Rome (88–99), presumed to be the first or second successor to Peter, is regarded as the first Apostolic Father of the Church.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="5"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi>. Saint Gregory the Great, Pope (590–604), instigated a large-scale mission from Rome to England to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. The author recounts a direct line of ecclesiastical authority from Christ to Peter, from Peter to Clement and Gregory, and then from Gregory to England via Saint Augustine of Canterbury. The Church’s divine authority is shown to have descended directly from Christ through the popes to the see of Canterbury.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6">14<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">ofte and ilome</hi>. “again and again.” For the idiom, see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> oft(e)</hi> (adv.), sense 1d and <hi rend="italic">ilome</hi> (adv.), sense 1b, and compare <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (art. 3), lines 48, 323.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7">15<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">myd some</hi>. “in accord.” Compare <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic"> Owl and the Nightingale</hi> (art. 2), line 180.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8">18–19<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Nu me kasteth . . . heo to grunde</hi>. As the poem advances to these central lines, the solid “Ston” undergirding the Church suffers a figural pulverization — the Rock is now a multitude of simoniacal coins — and a sinister inversion — the Church herself is now <hi rend="italic">being stoned</hi> (the biblical punishment for immoral women). The Old Norse verb <hi rend="italic">casten</hi> combined with the preposition <hi rend="italic">to</hi> denotes an action of throwing projectiles at and against “hire” (Holy Church). See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi> <hi rend="italic">casten</hi> (v.), sense 1a, “to throw (sth.) to a distance, fling, hurl,” and <hi rend="italic">to</hi> (prep.), sense 24a, “against (sb. or sth., God), in opposition to.” Compare <hi rend="italic">tocasten</hi> (v.), sense 1a, “to destroy (sth.),” a rare verb for which the only citation occurs in the Auchinleck manuscript. The verb of violent attack paints an image of both stoning and toppling. Operating as missiles, the silver and gold bruise and maim the vulnerable feminine body of Holy Church. Compare the affective imagining of Jesus’s maimed body at the center of <hi rend="italic">An Orision to Our Lord</hi> (art. 25), lines 30–34.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9">20<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Nis nu non that wile, for hire, tholie deth ne </hi><hi rend="italic">wunde</hi>. The argument expressed here is that no one — churchman or otherwise — is willing nowadays to suffer the pain of persecution or martyrdom in defense of Holy Church. Among the poems of Jesus 29, this argument is expressed most strongly in <hi rend="italic">On Serving Christ</hi> (art. 18).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="10">21<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Seynt Thomas</hi>. Saint Thomas of Canterbury (ca. 1120–1170), archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 until his murder in 1170. He was rapidly canonized and popularly venerated as a defender of the Church against the Crown. He is celebrated elsewhere in Jesus 29 in <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic"> Antiphon of Saint Thomas the Martyr</hi> and <hi rend="italic">On Serving Christ</hi> (arts. 17, 18).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="11">22<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">The Archebisscop Stephne</hi>. Stephen Langton (1150–1228) was archbishop of Canterbury (1207–1228). A dispute between King John of England and Pope Innocent III over his election helped to lead to the Magna Carta in 1215. Historian C. H. Lawrence explains how “This episode inaugurated the most famous conflict between Church and monarchy in the history of medieval England. In the face of John’s stubborn refusal to yield, a papal interdict was laid upon the country and published in all the churches on 23 March 1208. It was not to be lifted until the summer of 1214. During these five years, no services were held in the churches, the bells were silent, and the laity were denied the sacraments saving only the baptism of infants and the confession and absolution of the dying” (Paris, <hi rend="italic">The Life of St Edmund</hi>, trans. and ed. Lawrence, pp. 24–25). Stephen Langton remained politically active during Henry III’s early reign, sometimes speaking for the barons, sometimes allying with the king. In the 1220s he won concessions from Pope Honorius III that favored the English Church and exalted the see of Canterbury.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="12">23<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Seynt Admund</hi>. Saint Edmund Rich (ca. 1174–1240), also known as Edmund of Abingdon, was archbishop of Canterbury (1233–1240) in the early part of Henry III’s reign. Canonized a saint in 1246, he was known as a fervent defender of the Church. His devotional treatise, <hi rend="italic">Speculum ecclesiae</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Mirror of Holy Church</hi>), was translated into French and Middle English, and gained a popular following. For a discussion of his influence and a bibliography, see <hi rend="italic">VLT</hi>, pp. 212–22. See, too, Matthew Paris’s <hi rend="italic">Life of St. Edmund</hi> (trans. Lawrence, pp. 118–67).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13">24<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wurschipe</hi>. See <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to line 6,</ref> above.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14">25<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">uvele under honde</hi>. “under wicked governance.” The phrase <hi rend="italic">under honde</hi> metaphorically complements the theme that the Church is “under foot.” Compare line 33. </note>
 <note type="enote" n="15">27–32<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Bispes and clerekes . . . so swythe stronge</hi>. For other instances of estates satire in the Jesus 29 lyrics, compare <hi rend="italic">The Saws of Saint Bede</hi> (art. 4), lines 91–174; <hi rend="italic">Ten Abuses</hi> (art. 15), lines 2–11; and <hi rend="italic">A Little Sooth Sermon</hi> (art. 16), lines 17–24. The trope frequently surfaces in venality complaint poems. On this aspect of <hi rend="italic">Holy Church</hi> compared to <hi rend="italic">The Simonie</hi>, see Fein, “<hi rend="italic">When Holy Church Is Under Foot</hi>,” pp. 17–20. On <hi rend="italic">The Simonie</hi> (preserved in the Auchinleck manuscript), see Wright, ed., <hi rend="italic">Political Songs of England</hi>, pp. 323–45; Embree and Urquhart, eds., <hi rend="italic">The Simonie</hi>; and Dean, ed., <hi rend="italic">Medieval English Political Writings</hi>, pp. 193–212.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="16">32<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Heo let heom alle iwurthe that beoth so swythe stronge</hi>. “He lets powerful men do as they please.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">iworthen</hi> (v.), sense 4a, “to let (sb.) do as he chooses.” The mastermind of simony, the pope himself, solicits money from powerful estates (bishops, clerks, knights, bondsmen, kings, and earls), and then looks the other way as they rapaciously abuse Holy Church. The verb <hi rend="italic">iworthen</hi> extends the embodied feminine metaphor: the pope lets them do as they please, or, in ten Brink’s suggestive translation, “all do their will” (<hi rend="italic">History of English Literature</hi>, trans. Kennedy, 1:317).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="17">33<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">under vote!</hi> “under subjection, vanquished, overcome” (literally “under foot”). See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> fot</hi> (n.), sense 14y, and <hi rend="italic">under-fot</hi> (adv.), sense 1b.</note>
