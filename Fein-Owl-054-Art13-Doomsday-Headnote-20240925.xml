        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-054-Art13-Doomsday-Headnote"/><div type="text">
 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1"><hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi> survives in four manuscripts, and in every one it prefaces <hi rend="italic">Death</hi>, a longer poem in the same meter. In fact, the two moral exhortations seem barely differentiated from one another because there is never an incipit for the second poem and their layouts always match. One may infer, therefore, that a single poet produced both poems, as Brown asserts (p. 187). The manuscripts certainly present them as if this is the case.</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">In content, <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi> evokes terror over the impending signs of doom, during which sinners will feel utterly helpless. The signs, which will begin on a Sunday evening, are an all-consuming fire, trumpets sounded by angels, and Christ’s appearance as judge. Mary will be there, but it will be too late to call out for mercy. And, unfortunately for living sinners, the Devil works to keep mankind blind and forestall their timely prayers. At the Judgment, Christ will speak kindly to the righteous, harshly to the sinful, and then consign each side to its respective reward or damnation; compare <hi rend="italic">The Saws of Saint Bede</hi> (art. 4), lines 265–324. The poem ends with an exhortation to pray to Mary that she intercede on the petitioners’ behalf.</p>
 <p style="body" n="2">There is little substantial variation between the Jesus and Cotton texts of <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi>: both have eleven stanzas in the same sequence. Eleven strophes also appear in the Cambridge manuscript, TCC, MS B.14.39, but stanzas 6 and 7 appear in reverse order. In the TCC version, the sight of Christ as Judge occupies the central seventh stanza; in Cotton/Jesus, the central moment is the sight of merciful Mary. The TCC reversal of stanzas 6 and 7 is also found in MS Digby 86, but because Digby has two unique stanzas appearing before the last one, this longest version also places Mary in the central stanza.</p>
 <p style="body" n="3">The extra stanzas in Digby simply reiterate the lesson that every living person sprung from Adam must repent, and they warn the reader to pray for mercy before “þe latemeste dai.” The insertion verbally connects to the first line of <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> in Digby: “Þench of þe latemeste dai, hou we shulen fare” (Stengel, ed., <hi rend="italic">Codicem manu scriptum Digby 86</hi>, p. 98, stanzas 39–41). In Digby, the sequence of <hi rend="italic">Doomsday-Death</hi> is appended, with minimal sign of transition, to <hi rend="italic">The Debate between the Body and the Soul</hi>, composed in a very similar meter. The conjoining of <hi rend="italic">Debate</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> appears to be the Digby scribe’s own creative operation (Brown, pp. 187–88; Fein, “The Middle English Poetry of MS Digby 86”).</p>
 <p style="body" n="4">All surviving copies of <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi> present it in long lines. The Digby scribe joins stanzas with red tie-lines in the right margin. The TCC scribe denotes stanzas with left-margin paraphs and horizontal lines in the right margin. The Cotton scribe copies each stanza without line breaks (like prose), but with punctuation that matches the long-line copying found typically in Jesus 29. A capital marks the beginning of each stanza in both Cotton and Jesus. Morris prints the poem in 8-line stanzas despite the absence of internal rhymes. All three of the other versions of <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi> may be viewed by digital facsimile.
