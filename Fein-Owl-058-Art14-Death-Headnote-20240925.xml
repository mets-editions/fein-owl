        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-058-Art14-Death-Headnote"/><div type="text">
 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">The opening of <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> is indicated not by an incipit, but by an exhortation to “listen” — a common trope for opening — which comes immediately after <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi>’s closing invocation to pray. As explained in the headnote for art. 13, <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi> and this poem are presented in all manuscripts as a joined pair. Both have the same meter, are related in content and monitory style, and were surely composed by the same writer. In Oxford, BodL, MS Digby 86, the scribe appends <hi rend="italic">The Debate between the Body and the Soul </hi>to both <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Death</hi>, with which both poems have overlapping content.</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">Calling it by its alternate title, <hi rend="italic">The Latemest Day</hi>, Pearsall characterizes <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> as a poem of “grim strength and imaginative limitation” (<hi rend="italic">Old and Middle English Poetry</hi>, p. 96). At a length of thirty-three stanzas, it is three times longer than <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi>. It continues the same subject by addressing the need of the living to avoid distractions from the Devil and the World, and to contemplate the reality of death and the soul’s final fate. Addressing the reader who sits comfortably in rich clothes, the moralist reminds him how he had nothing when born and will have nothing when he departs. When Death enters us (line 27), we will become a mere corpse, a “cley-clot” (clay-clod; line 37). Our friends will take our possessions, and our lonely soul will lament. Then the soul will utter recriminations against the foolish body, with arguments that align with the body/soul debate tradition. Details of the grave — of worms gruesomely supplanting one’s former comfort in clothes — become part of the reformative rhetorical strategy, which is soon succeeded by a graphic description of hell-fire and the Fiend, who sports hideous horns on his knees (line 114). The poem concludes with an exhortation to avoid lechery (“hordom”; line 125), have masses sung, and perform charitable acts, and then closes with a conventional prayer to achieve heaven.</p>
 <p style="body" n="2"><hi rend="italic">Death</hi> possesses an intriguing structural likeness to <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi>, which can be taken as another mark of shared authorship. Both show signs of an author wanting to push the subjects’ grim limits toward escape routes. While <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi> situates the sight of Mary in the central stanza, and then closes in prayer to her as intercessor, <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> sets the singing of masses and the giving of alms in the central stanza (lines 65–66), and then closes with those same ideas about how to achieve pardon. Both poems gain a kind of rhetorical elegance and power of persuasion by strategically setting such hopeful signs amid the desperate horror of the signs of doom and death.</p>
 <p style="body" n="3">As with <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi>, the Cotton version of <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> agrees with the Jesus version in the number and order of stanzas. And, again as with <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi>, Morris prints <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> in 8-line stanzas despite the absence of internal rhymes. The Cambridge, TCC, MS B.14.39, and Digby 86 versions of <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> are shorter poems, mainly because they both omit the first four stanzas and begin at line 17, which in Digby reads: “Þench of þe latemeste dai, hou we shulen fare” (Stengel, ed., <hi rend="italic">Codicem manu scriptum Digby 86</hi>, p. 98, stanza 41). The Digby version thus has twenty-nine stanzas, which agree with Cotton/Jesus stanzas 5–33. The version in TCC is quite different, though, because the stanzas are substantially rearranged and three unique stanzas have been added. Using the Cotton/Jesus stanza-sequence of <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> as the base-text, the twenty-nine stanzas in the TCC version are ordered as follows: 5, 6, 11, 7, 9, 10, 19, 20, 22, 21, 13, 23, 14, (new), 17, 15, 16, 18, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, (new), (new), 32, 33. The nine stanzas missing from the TCC version are 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 25, 26. All four versions end with the same stanza of prayer for protection from the Devil.</p>
