        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">The author of this engaging lyric calls it a “little true sermon” (line 2), but for modern readers of early Middle English, it is more than that: a rare, wry comedy of the human condition, cleverly and artfully composed. The poet preaches of the need for all sinners to repent, while his vignette of an English village bustling with life radiates not so much despair as a sense of bemusement with the unending generational cycles of human weakness. The Watkins, Wilkins, and Malkins who inhabit the town pursue their desires in ways a preacher must judge ungodly, yet their antics brim with the transgressive vitality one finds in fabliau. Brewers and bakers overcharge for weak goods, adolescents defy parents, and a foolish girl finds herself with child.</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">The poem is written in long-line couplets that Morris printed as four lines despite their lack of internal rhymes. The couplets fall semantically into pairs, and I present the poem, accordingly, in sets of four long lines, even though stanza divisions are not indicated by either scribe. A pithy sermon-within-a-sermon on the subject of Adam’s Fall (lines 9–16) is written in four octosyllabic couplets. Thus, in departing from the surrounding meter of long septenary lines, it stands as a separate and distinct unit. It is, in essence, a precise eight-line lesson — the “little true sermon” — for which the rest of the poem is the exemplum displaying mankind’s fallen condition. For recent commentary on <hi rend="italic">A Little Sooth Sermon</hi>, see Hahn, “Early Middle English,” p. 81; and Fein-Children, pp. 224–26.
