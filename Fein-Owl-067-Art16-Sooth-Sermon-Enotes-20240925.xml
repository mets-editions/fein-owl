        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-067-Art16-Sooth-Sermon-Enotes"/><div type="text">
 <note type="enote" n="1">1–4<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Herkneth </hi><hi rend="italic">alle gode . . . feol into helle</hi>. The preacher’s core theme of the Fall, which affects everyone, is metaphorically broached in the first stanza when the audience is told to sit “down” (line 1) to hear a tale about the consequences of Adam’s downfall.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="2">9–16<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">He made him</hi><hi rend="italic"> . . . so strong atfalle</hi>. Written in a new meter, these eight lines boil the biblical lesson down to a sound-bite: Adam fell and had to stay in hell until Christ’s Passion redeemed him; we are all fallen, but Christ’s death can save us. The first and last rhymes reinforce the theme: <hi rend="italic">falle . . . atfalle</hi>. Adam’s Fall is often mentioned in the poetry of Jesus 29; compare, for example, <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (art. 3), line 195. <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic"> Little Sooth Sermon</hi> gives the subject its most extended and lively treatment.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3">17–24<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Alle bakbytares . . . seolver heo tulleth</hi>. The list of miscreants begins generically, seems all-male, and refers to actual sins: backbiters, robbers, thieves, murderers, lechers, whoremongers. The second part of the list remains male but moves into everyday professions: merchants, bakers, and brewers. Increasing specificity moves the list into the daily life of a village. The <hi rend="italic">Sooth Sermon</hi> poet is strategically adapting the topos of estates satire. For other instances in Jesus 29, see <hi rend="italic">The Saws </hi><hi rend="italic">of Saint Bede</hi> (art. 4), lines 91–174; <hi rend="italic">When Holy </hi><hi rend="italic">Church Is Under Foot</hi> (art. 12), lines 27–32; and <hi rend="italic">Ten</hi><hi rend="italic"> Abuses</hi> (art. 15), lines 2–11.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4">24<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">tulleth</hi>. “obtain through guile, wheedle.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">tillen</hi> (v.(3)), sense 1c.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="5">25<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Bothe heo maketh</hi><hi rend="italic"> feble heore bred and heore ale</hi>. “Both of them weaken their bread and their ale.” The central line of <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic"> Little Sooth Sermon</hi> depicts a false Eucharist being dispensed by the greedy brewers and bakers — more signs of the world’s fallen, blind indifference to God’s sacrifice.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6">27<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Gode men</hi>. An exhortation to the audience as “good men” occurs thrice in the poem, at beginning, middle, and end (lines 1, 27, 49), demonstrating a rhetorically-controlled, preacherly style.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7">29<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">preostes wives</hi>. The surprising mention of priests and their wives has elicted comment. See Pearsall, who writes colorfully that the poem “develops its theme of penitence on a frankly popular level: among those who will go to hell are . . . priests’ wives (one imagines cheers)” (<hi rend="italic">Old and Middle English Poetry</hi>, p. 97); and Heffernan, who soberly notes how “The wives of priests come in for especial condemnation and are damned to hell. This . . . rebuke . . . may speak to a genuine problem in the ranks of the rural clergy” (<hi rend="italic">MWME</hi>, 11:4046). Compare <hi rend="italic">The Simonie</hi>, line 52: “And late the parsoun have a wyf, and the prest another” (Wright, ed., <hi rend="italic">Political Songs of England</hi>, p. 326).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8">33<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">At chireche and at chepyng</hi>. Compare <hi rend="italic">The Proverbs</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Alfred</hi> (art. 24), line 254: “At chepynge and at chireche.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9">34<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">derne luve</hi>. “secret love.” In this moral context, the term hints of the adolescents’ sexual transgressions. The term is also very commonly found in secular love lyrics, such as those of Harley 2253 — see <hi rend="italic">Annot and John</hi>, line 36; <hi rend="italic">A Beauty White as Whale’s Bon</hi>, line 5; and <hi rend="italic">The Way of Woman’s Love</hi>, line 2 (<hi rend="italic">CHMS</hi>, 2:122, 2:152, 3:242) — and in Chaucer’s Miller’s Tale (<hi rend="italic">CT</hi> I[A]3200). See also <hi rend="italic">The Owl </hi><hi rend="italic">and the Nightingale</hi> (art. 2), line 1357.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="10">38<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Paternoster</hi>. The unmarried young people attend church only to flirt and socialize, and the girl who leaves her Paternoster (prayer book) locked up at home represents their collective neglect of the holy service. The reference to “Our Father” taps into a theme of paternity — from Adam to God, from Giloth’s <hi rend="italic">syre</hi> (line 45) to the father of her unborn child — that runs neatly through the lyric. See Fein-Children, p. 225. The image of a locked box opposes the girl’s dalliance, seen as a threat to her virginity. For female virginity figured as a locked “bower,” compare <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19), line 74.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="11">39–40<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Masses and matynes . . .</hi><hi rend="italic"> in hire </hi><hi rend="italic">thouht</hi>. The catalogue of sinners, having advanced to recognizable types with homespun names, next moves to the inner motives of weak-minded women. The young girl thinks of boys, not God’s worship.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="12">31–41<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Ne theos prude</hi><hi rend="italic"> . . . to than ale</hi>. The parade of sinners gains increasing familiarity as girls are added and homespun nicknames bring them to life: Malkin, Jankin, Watkin, Wilkin, Robin, Giloth. They flirt, as young people do, both at market and in church.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13">47–48<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">ne com hire</hi><hi rend="italic"> . . . aryse an heyh</hi>. The womb of the unwed girl is the only thing that rises in this fallen world. Her denial that any man has touched her ironically echoes Mary’s words at the Annunciation: “How shall this be done, because I know not man?” (Luke 1:34). See <hi rend="italic">Song of the Annunciation</hi> (art. 20), line 11.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14">51<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Seynte Marie</hi>. The final prayer for intercession from Mary interrupts the theme of inevitable, inter-generational fallenness that tumbles forth from “Adam ure vorme-fader” (line 4), that is, from father to father. The poem ends on a maternal note, with a prayer that God’s human mother, weeping tears, may intercede and help to advance all to the bliss of heaven.</note>
