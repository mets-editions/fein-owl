        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-070-Art17-Antiphon-Thomas-Headnote"/><div type="text">
 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">Like <hi rend="italic">Caedmon’s Hymn</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Antiphon of</hi><hi rend="italic"> Saint Thomas the Martyr in English</hi> is (by legend) of divine origin. It is reported that an apparition of monks in white robes taught it to Reginald, a priest of Wretham, Norfolk, and ordered him to sing it in veneration of Saint Thomas even before the archbishop was officially canonized in 1173 (three years after his martyrdom). The story is included in the <hi rend="italic">Miracles of St. Thomas</hi> recorded by William, a monk of Canterbury who witnessed Thomas’s murder, so the antiphon and its origin-legend are of solid pedigree and early in date, although the two manuscripts of <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi> (Jesus 29 and Winchester College, MS 4, which holds the legend) are each from the thirteenth century (Robertson, ed., <hi rend="italic">Materials</hi>, 1:150–51; Brown, pp. 196–98). In the Winchester MS, <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi> resides in an all-Latin context. Using it as an example, Hahn notes how such English lyrics “seem to have functioned as performance texts, inserted into sermons as audio enhancements to the more serious and systematic discourse of a homily, sound bites that captivated an audience’s attention by speaking their own language” (“Early Middle English,” p. 78). It is therefore of great interest that the Jesus 29 copy of <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi> presents it as having a function within an all-English sequence.</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">In Jesus 29, <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi> serves a specific purpose: it is the choral introit to the next item, <hi rend="italic">On Serving</hi><hi rend="italic"> Christ</hi> (art. 18), that is, an office sung for Saint Thomas to preface a homily on the martyr’s heroism. <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi>’s final word, <hi rend="italic">Euouae</hi>, indicates choral chanting. In addition to its musical setting, <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi>’s language matters too. The incipit written in red to the right of the poem specifically names its chosen language because Thomas is a saint native to the English tongue. The key idea is that Saint Thomas will offer special intercession for whoever prays in English: he is a “help in Engelaunde” (line 7). By this formulation, linguistic identity stands for national identity, and “nation” as a concept is conjoined with an evangelical drive to see to the salvation of the English populace. Consequently, the paired presence of <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">On Serving Christ</hi> outwardly expresses the religious-nationalist zeal that is often implicit in the lyrics of Jesus 29. Similar flashes of Englishness can be spotted in some poems preceding <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Ten Abuses</hi> (which quotes Bede) and <hi rend="italic">A Little Sooth Sermon</hi> (brimming with the rhythms of parochial village life) (arts. 15, 16). The work that comes after <hi rend="italic">On Serving Christ</hi> — <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19) — includes a tribute to King Henry III. King Alfred is the vernacular font of wisdom in <hi rend="italic">The Owl and the Nightingale</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Proverbs of Alfred</hi> (arts. 2, 24), and the former poem also names an English King Henry at<ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal"> line 1091 (see note)</ref>. A political dimension is thus at play in the poetry of Jesus 29, and this aspect of the verse deserves more attention.</p>
