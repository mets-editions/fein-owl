        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <note type="enote" n="1">5<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">rauht</hi>. “stretched (on the cross).” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> rechen</hi> (v.(1)), sense 8c.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="2">6<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">duthe</hi>. “people, retainers.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> douth(e)</hi> (n.), a word derived from OE <hi rend="italic">duguþ</hi>. Compare line 15; and <hi rend="italic">The Proverbs of Alfred</hi> (art. 24), line 111: “dowethes Louerd” (Lord of hosts).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3">8<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">faht</hi>. “resisted.” The word, past participle of <hi rend="italic">fighten</hi>, refers to Christ’s passivity on the cross. It is an appropriate descriptor of God in the context of human resistance to God’s will. Morris retains <hi rend="italic">faht</hi> but notes (p. 251; glossary, s.v. <hi rend="italic">Faht</hi>) that the word could be an error for <hi rend="italic">saht</hi>, “reconciled, accorded,” which would make <hi rend="italic">us</hi> the subject of the clause (compare line 1). There is no need to accept that reading as better, however. A syntax that describes God’s attributes in a long line’s second clause, set at a distance from the referent, is very common in the verse of Jesus 29.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4">10<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">asyen</hi>. “decline, collapse.” This rare verb denotes downward movement, as with the setting sun; see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">asien</hi>, sense 1b, where this line is cited. </note>
 <note type="enote" n="5">19<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Nis so wlonk under Crist ridynde on stede</hi>. This line begins with a colored capital, marking lines 19–24 as separate from lines 9–18, but the rhyme continues as if all sixteen lines are one <hi rend="italic">laisse</hi>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6">25–28<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Ther is the sunfulle . . . and gryslich gle</hi>. These lines describe the terror of Doomsday (the end of the world), when Christ will appear before every trembling soul, living and dead, and assign one of three paths to each: everlasting heaven; everlasting hell; or purgatory, where one dwells in pain with a glimmer of hope that eventually he or she will attain heaven. This three-way division of souls is the meaning of line 27, where the heirs of Adam will be <hi rend="italic">parted on thre</hi>. Compare the idea of these fates as forms of “eternal life” in <hi rend="italic">The Homily on Sooth Love</hi> (art. 26), <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">line 24 (note)</ref>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7">38<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">hethene-hode</hi>. “heathen belief or practices.” This word is recorded only in this line and three times in the later Middle English religious work <hi rend="italic">Cursor Mundi</hi>. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> hethenhede</hi> (n.), sense 1a.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8">39–40<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Seynte Peter . . . thet</hi><hi rend="italic"> he stode</hi>. The naming of Saint Peter, Jesus’s apostle and the founder of Holy Church, occurs at the center of <hi rend="italic">On Serving Christ</hi>. As in <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19), a cross is figured in the poem’s central line. As the first model of heroic martyrdom in <hi rend="italic">On Serving Christ</hi>, Saint Peter stands for the Church’s ideal stance against secular powers. His martyrdom by upside-down crucifixion was a well-known feature of his legend. See Jacobus de Voragine, <hi rend="italic">The Golden Legend</hi>, trans. Ryan, 1:345; and, for an Anglo-Norman version, see <hi rend="italic">CHMS</hi>, 1:420–23. Elsewhere in Jesus 29, the narrative of Peter’s denial of Christ prior to the Crucifixion is dramatically recounted in <hi rend="italic">The Passion of </hi><hi rend="italic">Jesus Christ</hi> (art. 1), lines 137–300.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9">46<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">dute </hi><hi rend="italic">his dede</hi>. “undergo or perform his death.” The verb is <hi rend="italic">don</hi>, “to do, perform,” not <hi rend="italic">douten</hi>, “to be in doubt of, to fear.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> don</hi> (v.(1)), senses 1a and 1d.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="10">44–47<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Hw Seynte Laurence</hi><hi rend="italic"> . . . horyen and schede</hi>. Saint Lawrence, martyred December 31, 225, was an early deacon of Rome, in charge of the Church’s treasury. Before his execution, he distributed the Church’s wealth to the poor, and then presented the poor people themselves before the prefect as the embodiment of Church riches. His legend attests that he was martyred by a slow, painful roasting over hot coals. On how his passion was considered especially heroic, see Jacobus de Voragine, <hi rend="italic">The Golden Legend</hi>, trans. Ryan, 2:64–74. Jacobus ascribes Lawrence’s persecution to Decius Caesar (2:67), a Roman ruler also named in <hi rend="italic">The Passion</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Jesus Christ</hi> (art. 1), line 686.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="11">47<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">schede</hi>. “waste, destroy.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> sheden</hi> (v.), sense 6e, where this line is cited.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="12">48<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">hirdsype</hi>. This instance of the word is the only one recorded in Middle English. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> hirdshipe</hi> (n.): “?Life or service in a household.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13">51–56<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Seynte Johan . . . byterluker ibouht</hi>. Like those of the other martyred saints, the poet’s narrative of John the Baptist stresses the saint’s determination to follow God over man. John the Baptist’s strength of will seems to mirror God’s own purposeful creation of the world “myd his thouht” (line 52). Herod’s beheading of John the Baptist is recounted in Matthew 14:3–11 and Mark 6:17–28. Perhaps the emphasis on “thoht” in the rhyme is meant to reflect John the Baptist’s martyrdom by beheading.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14">63<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">the dute of the Dom</hi>. “in awe of Doomsday.” The poet indulges in alliterative variation and wordplay, seen in how this phrase reshapes <hi rend="italic">tholede dom vor his duthe</hi> (“suffered judgment for his people,” line 6) said about Jesus, and <hi rend="italic">dute</hi><hi rend="italic"> his dede</hi> (“performed his death,” line 46) said about Saint Lawrence. On the meaning of <hi rend="italic">dute</hi>, see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> doute</hi> (n.), sense 3b, “awe, reverence, respect, fear (of God).”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="15"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">solde</hi>. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> sellen</hi> (v.), sense 1d, “to give up (one’s life), deliver up.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="16">57–64<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Seynt Thomas . . . beon in holde</hi>. The inclusion of Thomas of Canterbury brings the narrative of four martyrdoms to a climax by clear design, moving from biblical and early Church martyrs to the most famous of modern English martyrs (d. December 29, 1170). Again, the narrative emphasizes the saint’s Christlike nonresistance to persecution. The preceding <hi rend="italic">Antiphon of Saint Thomas the </hi><hi rend="italic">Martyr</hi> (art. 17) seems therefore to be the preface for <hi rend="italic">On Serving Christ</hi>. It asserts that Thomas is equal to all the apostles and of particular intercessory help to English people.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="17">64<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">beon in holde</hi>. “to resist, to be restrained”; see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> hold</hi> (n.(2)), sense 5. The scribe does not write the final word of this line, leaving a blank. Alliteration, rhyme, and sense point to the missing word being <hi rend="italic">holde</hi> — not <hi rend="italic">wolde</hi>, as Morris suggests (p. 92). The word accords with the poem’s general theme of how sinful men stupidly resist being faithful to God, although it would save them, and how specific martyrs model heroic conformity to God’s will.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="18">69<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">no grene</hi><hi rend="italic"> ne no scarlat non</hi>. Bright colors refer to the rich clothing of wealthy laypeople, contrasted to drab colors worn by laborers or men in religious orders (line 70). Rhetorically, this line completes the argument about the futility of beautiful clothes (lines 18–24). Compare <hi rend="italic">Doomsday</hi> (art. 13), line 14; and <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> (art. 14), line 5. In <hi rend="italic">The Saws of Saint Bede</hi> (art. 4), line 134, these colors appear to denote gowns worn by lawyers.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="19">70<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">of russet ne of rencyan</hi>. “of gray wool or mottled brown.” The line draws a contrast to the bright colors worn by aristocrats in <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">line 69 (see note,</ref> above). The reference is to either clothes worn by lower classes or robes worn by friars or monks. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> russet</hi> (n.), sense 1a, “gray or dull red, brown, suitable for working clothes,” and <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> rencian</hi> (n.), “a kind of cloth made in or associated with Reims.” In the mid-thirteenth century, the wealthy baron Simon de Montfort reportedly wore simple clothes of coarse russet as a private act of humility, doing so in emulation of friars; at the same time, friars warned against the wearing of rich scarlet (Maddicott, <hi rend="italic">Simon de Montfort</hi>, pp. 88–92). It is of particular interest that the word <hi rend="italic">rencian</hi> is recorded only twice in Middle English: here and in <hi rend="italic">Love</hi><hi rend="italic"> Rune</hi> (art. 19), line 53 (the work that directly follows). The verbal correspondence and physical juxtaposition may be clues that Thomas authored both poems. Compare also the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to lines 39–40</ref>, above.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="20">71<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">that ruskit the ron</hi>. “that startle (game) in the thicket.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> rusken</hi> (v.), sense 1a, “to start (game),” a rare word of Old Norse origin; and <hi rend="italic">ron</hi> (n.3), sense 1b, “a thicket, bush, shrubbery.” The word <hi rend="italic">ron</hi> is also mistakenly cited in the <hi rend="italic">MED</hi> under <hi rend="italic">ro</hi> (n.(1)), as a plural form of <hi rend="italic">roe</hi>, “deer.” </note>
 <note type="enote" n="21">69–72<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">no grene ne no scarlet . . . body and the bon!</hi> The evocation of a noble hunt alongside the mention of beautiful clothes hints of the classic <hi rend="italic">ubi sunt</hi> topos (“where are they now?”), as found in <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (art. 3), <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">line 358 (note)</ref>; <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> (art. 14), lines 49–56; and <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19), lines 33–36. On the <hi rend="italic">ubi sunt</hi> tradition, see Woolf, pp. 95–96.</note>
