        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1"><hi rend="italic">Song of the Annunciation</hi>, a paraphrase of Luke 1:28–38, survives in damaged form as a fragment of twelve opening lines. It must be deliberate that an Annunciation hymn follows <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> in Jesus 29 because <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> adopts the premise of an annunciatory message delivered to a “maid of Christ,” borne by a go-between (like Gabriel) who serves God’s amatory business. Thus, after the maiden of <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> is bid to sing the runic message (line 102), the holiest of angelic pronouncements appears under the scribe’s rubric “Item cantus” (A song). Perhaps in its original presentation <hi rend="italic">Song</hi> was appended to <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi>, and, if so, then Thomas of Hales could be its author. The surviving lines suggest a poem of great delicacy. Elsewhere, Thomas’s treatment of the theme is extant in his Latin <hi rend="italic">Vita sancte Marie</hi> (Horrall, ed., <hi rend="italic">The Lyf of Oure Lady</hi>, pp. 47–51).</p>
 <p style="body" n="1"><hi rend="italic">Song of the Annunciation</hi> has been erroneously printed by previous editors in combination with <hi rend="italic">The Annunication</hi> (art. 10), another fragment, but the makeup of Jesus 29 precludes the possibility that the items belong to the same poem. In addition, their meters are decidedly different. Irregular rhymes in the surviving fragment make the precise meter of <hi rend="italic">Song</hi> difficult to pin down, but it seems to be similar to that of the Harley 2253 political poem <hi rend="italic">The Flemish Insurrection</hi> (<hi rend="italic">CHMS</hi>, 2:214–21), which commemorates an event of 1307.</p>
