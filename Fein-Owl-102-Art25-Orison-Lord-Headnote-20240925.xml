        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1"><hi rend="italic">An </hi><hi rend="italic">Orison to Our Lord</hi> is a powerful meditational prayer-poem deeply set in traditions of affective piety felt for the incarnate, humanized Jesus. It asks a reader to identify corporeally with Jesus from his conception and birth — when “his goddede wes ihud in fleys” (line 6) — to his sweet vulnerability as a humble, submissive child. The nature of such an appeal breeds instinctive, protective affection for what is small and innocent. Then begins a sensate, increasingly brutal depiction of the Passion, which climaxes at the poem’s center, where horrific images of torture give way to a surreal subtext of sovereignty because the Crucifixion marks the moment of incarnate God’s transcendent victory. Ultimately, the speaker affirms that his faith has been deepened by this intense meditation upon Jesus as an example of supreme forbearance and patience, which he must try to match by firm belief (lines 57–58).</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">Composed in thirty-two couplets of irregular length, the poem has seven stanzas as indicated by colored capitals at the beginning of each. Anaphoric greetings to God unite the stanzas. Their usual form is “Jhesu, ich the grete,” causing the orison to become a salutation that hails Jesus in each stanza. <hi rend="italic">Orison</hi>’s devotionalism resides empathetically in the petitioner’s sensate body. He is to imagine God in the flesh with his own flesh, meditating upon Jesus being born, raised, and then tortured. The prayer requests both bodily wellness and protection from God: “Of seorewe and sunne wite us myd isunde” (Keep us bodily whole against sorrow and sin; line 48). For further commentary on the fine craftsmanship of <hi rend="italic">An Orison </hi><hi rend="italic">to Our Lord</hi>, see Fein-Children, pp. 222–23.</p>
