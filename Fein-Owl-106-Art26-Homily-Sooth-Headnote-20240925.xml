        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Fein-Owl-106-Art26-Homily-Sooth-Headnote"/><div type="text">
 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">This work is a verse homily on the necessity of repentance and confession before death and Doomsday arrive — the terror-inducing theme found in much poetry in Jesus 29. The lesson comes tempered and sweetened, however, with another theological tiding: God’s abundant love. The opening line affirms the message: “Theo sothe love among us beo wythuten euch endynge” (True love is among us without any limit). If we are virtuous, worshipful, and serviceable, the preacher says, then we need not be frightened — we will shine brightly in paradise! The poet preaches submissive meekness, using Christ as the example, in a way that echoes the preceding poem, <hi rend="italic">An Orison</hi><hi rend="italic"> to Our Lord</hi> (art. 25). It might well be that the prayer-poem stands as introit to this homily.</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">The homily’s first half rehearses the usual gloomy lessons of inevitable death and final judgment. The middle stanza (lines 29–32) models the confession demanded of listeners: they need to cry for mercy and acknowledge their foul sins. The second half stresses God’s love: he desires souls to be drawn to heaven; he wants them to discover joy and bliss and see Christ’s face (line 33–36). There then follows a description of the “riche wunynge” (rich dwelling; line 45) of paradise, and how it is <hi rend="italic">we</hi> who must have and show true love so that we can obtain this reward. The poem closes with Pauline definitions of love (from 1 Corinthians), and a prayer that God show his love by freeing the prayerful from bondage and taking them to heaven.</p>
 <p style="body" n="2"><hi rend="italic">A Homily on Sooth Love</hi> is composed in the same meter (long lines with internal rhymes) as <hi rend="italic">Will and Wit</hi> (from Cotton), <hi rend="italic">The Five Joys of Our Lady Saint Mary</hi>, Thomas of Hales’s <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Fire and Ice</hi> (arts. 9, 11, 19, 21). It is conceivably another English poem written by Thomas, but one cannot determine authorship with any degree of certainty. The balanced style and love-centered content are compatible with <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi>, yet <hi rend="italic">Homily</hi> is undeniably a slighter work. As with the other lyrics in this meter, Morris sets <hi rend="italic">Homily</hi> in 8-line stanzas despite the fact that the scribe lays it out in long lines. He names it <hi rend="italic">The Duty of Christians</hi>, but the title provided here reflects the comforting message offered in the first line: “sothe luve.” In <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi>, the layout is a critical element of its numerological structure, which the scribe maintains. The layout in long lines is therefore preserved for <hi rend="italic">A Homily on Sooth Love</hi> as well.</p>
 <p style="bodysubection">[Fols. 193r–194r. <hi rend="italic">NIMEV</hi> 3474. <hi rend="italic">DIMEV</hi> 5479. <hi rend="bold">Quire</hi>: 5. <hi rend="bold">Meter</hi>: 60 septenary lines with internal rhymes, <hi rend="italic">aaaa</hi><hi rend="subscript">7</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">(ab</hi><hi rend="italic">)(ab)(ab)(ab)</hi><hi rend="subscript">7</hi>), in fifteen 4-line stanzas. <hi rend="bold">Layout</hi>: Long lines with strong caesuras and medial and end punctuation.
