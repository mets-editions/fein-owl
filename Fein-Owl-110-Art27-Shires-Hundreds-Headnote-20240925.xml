        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">This item is the only English prose text in Jesus 29. Dated 1086–1133, <hi rend="italic">The Shires and Hundreds of England</hi> appears to be the oldest item in Jesus 29 (Hill-History, pp. 206–07; Hill-Part2, p. 274n45). Like the short Latin prose bit that follows it in the manuscript, <hi rend="italic">Assisa panis Anglie</hi> (a legal statute on the pricing of bread), <hi rend="italic">Shires</hi> seems included for general reference. First, it enumerates the thirty-two shires and fifteen bishoprics of England, providing a history of how several bishoprics were founded. Then it enumerates the shires beyond the fourteenth-century borders of “England”: Northumberland, Lothian, Westmorland, Cumberland, and Cornwall.</p>
 <p style="body" n="1">Next the author names the three jurisdictional laws — West Saxon law, Danelaw, and Mercian law — and itemizes the shires that fall under each. For some counties (and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Mercian ones, which would be regional for the scribe), quantities of hides are specified. A hide is a variable measurement of land. Originally, the term denoted the amount required to support a family and its dependents (<hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> hide</hi> (n.(2), sense 1)). A hundred hides constitute a “hundred,” that is, an administrative division of a county that maintained its own court system (<hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> hundred</hi> (n.), sense 1), which would also reflect regional structures for taxation. <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic"> Shires and Hundreds of England</hi> thus profiles England as a nation with borders and with episcopal, legal, and economic jurisdictions. As the last item in the sequence of English poetry, it grounds the verse of Jesus 29 in an idea of Englishness that is both linguistic and geographical.</p>
 <p style="body" n="2">Little commentary on <hi rend="italic">Shires</hi> exists, but see Cannon, <hi rend="italic">The Grounds of English</hi><hi rend="italic"> Literature</hi>, pp. 53, 68–70, who compares it to maps and to <hi rend="italic">Brut</hi> (found in Cotton); and Cartlidge-Composition, p. 259, who notes how it is “at odds with the literary character” of Jesus 29. It is worth noticing, however, that <hi rend="italic">Shires</hi>’s practical, taxonomic interest in legal domains shares a topical interest (the law in general) with the quasi-legal wranglings in <hi rend="italic">The Owl and the </hi><hi rend="italic">Nightingale</hi> (art. 2).</p>
