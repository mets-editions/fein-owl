        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <p style="heading4">Paragraph 1</p>
 <note type="enote" n="1"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Katenes</hi>. Caithness, Scotland.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="2"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Dewyes-steowe</hi>. This place-name refers to Deastow, today called Berwick-upon-Tweed. Its Gaelic name is <hi rend="italic">Bearaig a Deas</hi>. Berwick-upon-Tweed is England’s northernmost town, located at the mouth of the River Tweed on the east coast.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">syndon</hi>. “(there) are, (there) exist.” This word is one of several third-person plural forms of the verb <hi rend="italic">ben</hi>; see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ben</hi> (v.).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">stol</hi>. “episcopal stool, bishopric.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> stol</hi> (n.), sense 1b, “an episcopal chair; also, an episcopal see or residence.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="5"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Eadward King</hi>. Saint Edward the Confessor was one of the last Anglo-Saxon kings of England (1042–1088). He appointed his chaplain Heremon as bishop of Ramsbury in 1045.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Heremon</hi><hi rend="italic"> Biscop</hi>. Heremon (or Herman) was bishop of Ramsbury and Sherborne before and after the Norman Conquest. He oversaw the unification and establishment of the episcopate at Salisbury in 1075. He was bishop of Salisbury from 1075 until his death in 1078.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Bridyport</hi>. The place named here should be Crediton, not Bridport, located in Dorset well to the east of Crediton and Exeter.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Leofrych Biscop</hi>. Under King Edward the Confessor, Leofric was appointed bishop of Cornwall and Crediton, which were eventually combined and relocated to Exeter, where he was bishop from 1050 until 1072. A bibliophile, he was the donor of the Exeter Book to Exeter Cathedral.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">on Willames daye the yonger kynges</hi>. “In the time of William the Younger,” referring to the reign of William Rufus, 1087–1100 (King William II), who was the son of William the Conqueror, first Norman king of England (1066–1087).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="10"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Johan</hi>. King John, who reigned over England from 1199 to 1216.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="11"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">other half thes wateres</hi>. “across the river.” Or perhaps, the phrase means “across the sea, ?Norway.” The historical jurisdictions of the medieval York episcopate are complex. According to Edwin Burton’s “Ancient See of York” in <hi rend="italic">The Catholic Encyclopedia</hi>: “Till the Danish invasion the archbishops of Canterbury occasionally exercised authority, and it was not till the Norman Conquest that the archbishops of York asserted their complete independence. At that time they had jurisdiction over Worcester, Lindsey, and Lincoln, as well as the dioceses in the Northern Isles and Scotland. But the first three sees just mentioned were taken from York in 1072. In 1154 the sees of Man and Orkney were transferred to the Norwegian Archbishop of Drontheim, and in 1188 all the Scottish dioceses except Whithern were released from subjection to York, so that Whithern, Durham, and Carlisle remained to the archbishops as suffragan sees.”</note>
 <p style="heading4">Paragraph 2</p>
 <note type="enote" n="12"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Lothen</hi>. “Lothian,” a region of southeast Scotland, which includes the city of Edinburgh.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Brutlaund</hi>. “Britain,” that is, probably Wales as opposed to “England.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">hundred hida</hi>. “hundred hides” or “hundreds.” A “hundred” is an area that operates its own jurisdictional court system and administration. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">hundred</hi> (n.), sense 1, and <hi rend="italic">hide</hi> (n.(2)), sense 1.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="15"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">xxvi. thusend hida and on half hundred</hi>. “twenty-six thousand and a half hundred hides.” The sum of the regional hides listed in this paragraph matches the total given (26,050 hides).</note>
