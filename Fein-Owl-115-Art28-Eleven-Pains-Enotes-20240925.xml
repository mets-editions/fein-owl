        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/fein-owl/blob/main/fein-owl-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <note type="enote" n="2">38<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">won</hi>. “woes,” a plural of <hi rend="italic">wo</hi>. The form is not listed at <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">wo</hi> (n.), but see Morris, p. 305 (glossary, s.v. <hi rend="italic">Woh</hi>).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3">33–40<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Erest, ther </hi><hi rend="italic">beoth bernynde treon . . . in wynter stal</hi>. Pain 1 is a place of burning trees with souls hung upon them; the souls number more than there are bees in hives. A large colored capital opens line 33 in Jesus 29, but not in Digby 86.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4">40<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">in wynter stal</hi>. “in winter’s hive.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> winter</hi> (n.), sense 3c, from OE <hi rend="italic">winter-steall</hi>, “a dwelling (residence, hive, an enclosure, etc.) providing protection, shelter, comfort, etc. during the cold part of the year.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="5">47<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">lyvred blod</hi>. “clotted blood.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> livered</hi> (ppl. adj.), sense 1a.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6">48<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">for wod</hi>. “fiercely.” For the phrase, see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">wode</hi> (n.(3)), sense 2b, the only instance with this definition cited. The phrase usually denotes intensity, frenzy, panic, or madness.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7">56<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">fleysse</hi><hi rend="italic"> to gal</hi>. “flesh too lascivious.” The definition of <hi rend="italic">gal</hi> is drawn from the context and provided in Morris’s glossary (p. 256; s.v. <hi rend="italic">Gal</hi> (adj.)), but the adjective is not cited in the <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>. Compare <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> gal(e)</hi> (n.(1)), sense 1d, “joy, merriment” — a word occurring in <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi> (art. 19),<ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal"> line 63 (note)</ref>; and see also the comic coinage <hi rend="italic">galegale</hi> in <hi rend="italic">The Owl</hi><hi rend="italic"> and the Nightingale</hi> (art. 2),<ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal"> line 256 (note)</ref>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8">59<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wondrawen</hi>. “state of misery, wretchedness.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> wandrawe</hi> (n.), where this line is the only cited occurrence.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9">41–66<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Seththen, ther is on ouen . . . </hi><hi rend="italic">never more</hi>. Pain 2 features a huge hot furnace into which demons toss souls. The punished souls number more than all the fish in the sea or birds in the air. The setting also contains the terrors of snow, ice, blood, and snakes. On the hellish combination of extreme heat and extreme cold in hell, compare Pain 6, lines 149–50; and also <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (art. 3), lines 228–30, and <hi rend="italic">The Saws of Saint Bede</hi> (art. 4), line 49. A large colored capital opens line 41 in both versions.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="10">72<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">That her </hi><hi rend="italic">arereden unryhte lawe</hi>. This line repeats line 60.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="11">67–74<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">A hwel</hi><hi rend="italic"> of stele . . . in the</hi><hi rend="italic"> snowe</hi>. Pain 3 features a gigantic wheel of steel with burning hot spikes, upon which souls are torn. The souls here number more than every snowflake. A large colored capital opens line 67 (Digby line 63) in both versions.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="12">85<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Heo hire awarieth al athrep</hi>. “They strangle them in flocks.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> awurien</hi> (v.), where the only citations are this line and three occurrences in <hi rend="italic">Ancrene Wisse</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> a-þrep</hi> (adv.), “as a horde or gang,” with this line being the only occurrence cited.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13">92<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">al fornon</hi>. “again and again.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> forn</hi> (adv.), sense 1a, “henceforth, ahead (in time).”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14">103<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">copynere</hi>. “paramours, illicit lovers.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> copenere</hi> (n.); and compare <hi rend="italic">The Owl </hi><hi rend="italic">and the Nightingale</hi> (art. 2), line 1342.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="15">75–118<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Further</hi><hi rend="italic">, ther is a water . . . pyne ilesteth o</hi>. Pain 4 features a stinking river of boiling black pitch, where demons strangle the souls. The sinners stand at different depths, according to their crimes. The backbiters are up to their knees; lechers are up to their necks; adulterers are up to their mouths; and so on. For the catalogue of sinners and the display of <hi rend="italic">contrapasso</hi>, compare <hi rend="italic">The Saws</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Saint Bede</hi> (art. 4),<ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal"> lines 91–174 (note)</ref>. A large colored capital opens line 75 in Jesus 29, but not in Digby 86 (line 73). Jesus Pains 3–4 are combined in the Digby version.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="16">131<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Thenne</hi><hi rend="italic"> beoth the wymmen further idon</hi>. This line marks the beginning of Digby Pain 5, headed with a large capital not found in the Jesus version.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="17">141<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">And furduden heore </hi><hi rend="italic">istreon</hi>. “And destroyed their offspring.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> istreon</hi> (n.), sense 1c. On the special punishment for women who kill unwanted infants, compare Audelay’s <hi rend="italic">Vision of Saint Paul</hi>, lines 139–44 (Audelay, <hi rend="italic">Poems and Carols</hi>, ed. Fein, p. 130).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="18">119–44<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Vurthur, is</hi><hi rend="italic"> a ful deop fen . . . tholieth thar such pyn</hi>. Pain 5 features a deep swamp where there are women who transgressed sexually and their wooers, plus (a bit incongruously) usurers. Demons chew their tongues in two, and, for the usurers, they draw out their brains. Women who rejected their illegitimate babies are basted in pitch with adders sucking their breasts. And there are also hellhounds and snakes. A large colored capital opens line 119 (Digby line 117) in both versions. Audelay’s <hi rend="italic">Vision of Saint Paul</hi>, lines 139–44 (Audelay, <hi rend="italic">Poems and Carols</hi>, ed. Fein, p. 130).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="19">145<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Vurther, ther beoth wimmen and wapmen bo</hi>. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> wepman</hi> (n.); the collocation <hi rend="italic">wepmen and wommen</hi> is common. The reversal here advertises how Pain 6 afflicts many female souls.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="20">145–62<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Vurther, ther beoth wimmen</hi><hi rend="italic"> . . . myd such sol</hi>. Pain 6 is a place for those who dispossessed the poor, where demons mutilate souls by splitting them in two and where vultures devour their stomachs. Half the sinners dwell in fire, and half dwell in a frozen marsh; compare <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to lines 41–66,</ref> above. A large colored capital opens line 145 (Digby line 143) in both versions.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="21">162<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Forthi, hi drayeth myd such sol</hi>. “For that, they are gutted so filthily.” For the verb <hi rend="italic">drayeth</hi>, see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> drauen</hi> (v.), sense 1a(g), the torture of being “drawn,” that is, dragged or gutted (compare <hi rend="italic">dreyeth</hi>, line 146). For <hi rend="italic">sol</hi>, see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> soile</hi> (n.(1)), where the usages are later, but compare <hi rend="italic">soilen</hi> (v.(1)), sense 1a, “to make (something) dirty, soil,” where instances include <hi rend="italic">Ancrene Wisse</hi>. See also Morris, p. 289 (glossary, s.v. <hi rend="italic">Sol</hi> = ?filth). The <hi rend="italic">MED</hi> lists this line under <hi rend="italic">sol</hi> (n.(4)), “rope,” but the resulting sense is unlikely. The stylistic similarity of this line to line 174 (the end of Pain 7) is notable.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="22">163–74<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Vurther, ther is o wateres . . . </hi><hi rend="italic">myd such bal</hi>. Pain 7 features a flaming bloody river, and the sinners there (commandment-breakers) are very hungry and thirsty. A large colored capital opens line 163 (Digby line 163) in both versions.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="23">174<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Forthi, hi pleyeth myd such bal</hi>. The similarity of this line to line 162 (the end of Pain 6) is stylistically notable. It is possible that the line also contains a sarcastic pun: “For that, they suffer such bale” and “For that, they play such ball (i.e., a baleful game).”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="24">189<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">For heo nolden beon ischriven</hi>. “For they wouldn’t be shriven.” On the vital importance of confession for salvation, a preacherly imperative throughout the lyrics of Jesus 29, compare <hi rend="italic">The Passion of Jesus Christ</hi> (art. 1), lines 547–52; and see the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">headnotes to <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi></ref> and <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal"><hi rend="italic">A Homily on Sooth Love</hi></ref> (arts. 3, 26).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="25">207–08<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Ac </hi><hi rend="italic">trichurs and lyeres, and les / That weren her — wo is </hi><hi rend="italic">ham thes!</hi> “But these traitors and liars, who / Were false here — woe to them!” Compare <hi rend="italic">The Owl and the Nightingale</hi> (art. 2), line 882: “That beoth her, wo is hom thes.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="26">175–218<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Vurther, ther beoth olde </hi><hi rend="italic">men . . . hit moste iseon</hi>. Pain 8 is a place filled with adders and snakes, where bones of sinners (the unshriven) fall apart and then rejoin. The poet interpolates here some moral comment: why didn’t these sinners know, understand, and take proper precautions when they were alive? Their neglect has put them in the same state as nonbelievers. A large colored capital opens line 175 (Digby line 174) in both versions.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="27">224<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">atdareth</hi>. This line is the only attested instance of this verb; see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">atdaren</hi> (v.), “escape by hiding.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="28">219–32<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">In helle is a deop gayhol . . . </hi><hi rend="italic">ever furlore</hi>. The movement seems to head downward from this point on, and maybe all the Pains are to be visualized, as in Dante’s <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi>, as a downward progression. Pain 9 features a deep dungeon having a hot pool, where demons tear the souls (those who falsely judged Jesus) with sharp awls. A large colored capital opens line 219 in Jesus 29, but not its equivalent in Digby 86 (Digby line 230). Digby lines 212–29 are unique, and at Digby lines 222–23 the sinners are described as more plentiful than the drops of wine in France.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="29">229–32<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">An heyh tofore . . . beoth ever furlore</hi>. The names of those in the deepest pit of hell, those who judged Jesus, will never again be uttered, and no saint dares to intercede for them. These lines express the medieval belief in saintly intercession, that is, the notion that holy Christians who led exemplary lives and were canonized as saints now have the posthumous power to respond to prayers directed to them by the living, and thus to petition efficaciously for God’s mercy on their behalf. The poet avers that the sufferers of Pain 9 have no redress in saintly aid, and these sinners — the ones who wickedly judged and condemned Jesus, as recounted in <hi rend="italic">The Passion of Jesus Christ</hi> (art. 1) — will be forever lost and nameless.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="30">233–50<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Vurther, ther his onother put . . . Cristes holy</hi><hi rend="italic"> passyun</hi>. Pain 10 features another hot pit, this one having seven doors and filled with hellhounds plus one lion, which seems to be the Devil (line 247). Here the sinners number more than leaves on a branch. No specific sin is named. A large colored capital opens line 233 (Digby line 244) in both versions.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="31">259<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">mansed bi nome</hi>. “excommunicated by name.” The Digby MS reads “acursed bi nome.” It is possible that “bi nome” should be read as the part participle <hi rend="italic">binome</hi>; see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> binimen</hi> (v.), senses 3a (“ruined”) and 4 (“seized, beset”).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="32">251–60<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Therunder, is of iren a wal . . . </hi><hi rend="italic">Godes grome</hi>. Pain 11, the deepest part of hell, features an iron-walled enclosure where sinners are restrained in hot iron fetters. They are named as those who were beheaded (perhaps as traitors), thieves, and excommunicants. A large colored capital opens line 251 (Digby line 262) in both versions. The speech of the revived sinner appears to end at line 260.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="33">260<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">grome</hi>. “anger, rage, hatred, hostility.” See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> gram(e)</hi> (n.), sense 1a.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="34">261<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Ich wile segge eu a soth</hi>. This line does not open with a colored initial, but a transition is indicated by the narrator’s shift from Pain 11 to a concluding exhortation. There is also no transition here in the Digby version (Digby line 274).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="35">266<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Kaym</hi>. Cain, the firstborn of Adam and Eve, hence, the first human conceived naturally. He slew his brother Abel and for that deed was cursed by God (Genesis 4:1–16).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="36">265–70<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Theyh on hundred</hi><hi rend="italic"> . . . a thusend mo!</hi> This statement ends the poet’s inexpressibility topos (his enumerations by simile) with a full-scale hyperbole: even though a hundred men had stayed awake since the birth of Cain, using teeth and tongues of steel (so they would not wear out), speaking always of hell’s pains, still there would be more pains to tell! The hyperbole works somewhat against the premise of a poem about eleven pains precisely. However, concluding with a hyperbole like this is part of the tradition. Compare Audelay’s <hi rend="italic">Vision of Saint Paul</hi>, lines 318–21: “And hunder men thagh ther were truly / Fro the bekynyng of world ay spekyng, / And uche a hundred tungis had, sothly, / Thai myght not tel the payns in hel duryng” (Even if there were truly a hundred men / From the beginning of the world always speaking, / And each had a hundred tongues, truly, / They might not express the pains being endured in hell) (Audelay, <hi rend="italic">Poems and Carols</hi>, ed. Fein, p. 124; translation mine). This statement comes immediately after Paul asks Michael to tell him the number of pains, and Michael provides him with a biblical answer: 144,000 pains (Apocalypse 7:4). Compare also <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (art. 3), lines 143–44, 271–88; <hi rend="italic">The Saws</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Saint Bede</hi> (art. 4), line 38; and <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> (art. 14), lines 29–30.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="37">274<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Ne helph heom wurth o </hi><hi rend="italic">slo</hi>. “not worth a sloe (the fruit of a blackthorn tree),” that is, worthless. Compare <hi rend="italic">An Orison to Our Lady</hi> (art. 8): “nys wurth a slo” (line 28, emended from MS Cotton Caligula A.ix).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="38">275<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Ac bidde we </hi><hi rend="italic">Crist that is us buve</hi>. The Digby version has a large initial at the beginning of this line (Digby line 286).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="39">281–82<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Ki</hi><hi rend="italic"> ces .xi. peynes . . . ly avendra</hi>. This couplet, a seemingly original explict, does not open with a colored initial, but a transition is indicated by the shift to French. French verses thus frame the poem (compare lines 1–6). The final lines are likely a scribal addition.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="40">290<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Thi</hi>. “For that, therefore.” See Morris, p. 295 (glossary, s.v. <hi rend="italic">Þe</hi>), and compare <hi rend="italic">Forthi</hi>, line 162. The scribe inserts a punctus after this word.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="41">283–91<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Hwoso wrot these </hi><hi rend="italic">pynen ellevene . . . Amen</hi>. This passage asks that the scribe (or poet), identified by name as “Hug’,” be granted heaven, for he is virtuous (“curteys and hendy,” line 289). The four couplets and Latin explicit seem appended to an original French explicit (lines 281–82). They are not set off with a colored initial, and they do not appear in the Digby version, which closes with four unique lines: “For þilke þat beþ Iboureuen, Iwis / hoe wendeþ into paradis; / So wolle god þat we mote / hounder-fongen heueriche bote” (For those who are obedient, indeed / they enter into paradise; / So may God grant that we may / receive heavenly reward) (Horstmann, ed., “Nachträge zu den Legenden,” p. 405; translation mine). In Digby, what follows next (without break) is a fragment from the lyric <hi rend="italic">Swete Jesus</hi>. Digby thus presents a different, scribe-composed ending — a soothing prayer after an account of hard pains; see Fein, “The Middle English Poetry of MS Digby 86,” p. 169. Compare the prayers for writers that appear at the end of <hi rend="italic">The Passion for Jesus Christ</hi> (art. 1), lines 697–702, and <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (art. 3), lines 389–90; and see the discussion of this passage in the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">General Introduction, pp. 9–10.</ref> </note>
